There would be no utility in an order for exemplary damages against Fletch that was too low to have real deterrent or exemplary value for a subsidiary of a listed company.Such an orderwould not discourage parties in similar situations from wrongdoing, wherethebenefitsof that wrongdoingwould likely then exceed its risksandwronged parties(and especiallyfinancially distressed companies) would often not have the resources to bring or sustain complex proceedings and (as here) damages can be difficult to quantify.",

The conduct in this case was calculated and it was deliberately concealed so as to maximise its prospects of success, to thePlaintiffs\u2019disadvantage. Although there is no necessity for proportionality between the amount of exemplary damages and the amount of compensatory damages, there is here a significant risk that the compensatory damages awarded to the1derfulCompanies will have understated their loss, because of theintrinsicdifficulties in proof of that loss in respect of a start-up company. I am satisfied that there is a proper basis for an order for exemplary damages against Fletch in the amount of $500,000, which is substantial although less than the amounts awarded inDirected Electronics.",

Mr Chiu signed the Employment Contract on 17 April 2020 containing clause 11.3, the terms of which I have set out at [18] above.

I reject Mr Chiu\u2019s submissions that it is reasonably arguable that clause 11.3, properly construed, applies only to information in physical or hard copy form. That construction is unarguable, in my opinion, because clause 11.3 expressly applies to\u201cConfidential Information\u201dwhich is defined in clause 15.1 as including\u201cinformation\u201d,\u201cdata\u201dand\u201cthings not reduced to material form\u201d."

Third,once the decision had been made in December 2016 to sell the Arndell Park property andsteps were taken to implement it,it was not unreasonable forthe executorto progress sale of the property rather than attempt to leaseit: see [581].There were also land taxissues which informed the executor\u2019s decision-making.",
      "There are various jurisdictional and discretionary steps that must be satisfied before a Court can make an order designating property as notional estate for the purposes of a family provision order or a costs order. I addressed these inClayton v Clayton[2023] NSWSC 399 at [607]-[627]. Further, in circumstances where a family provision application is made out of time, the Court must not make a notional estate order unless it is satisfied that special circumstances exist to justify the making of the notional estate order.[63]"
    ],
    "ground_truth": "Under the Succession Act 2006 (NSW), a plaintiff must specify the nature and amount of the provision sought, including the manner in which it is to be provided and the part of the estate out of which it is to be sourced. The claim must be clearly articulated in the originating process, and the plaintiff may seek a 'Crisp order' for a life estate, which involves creating a testamentary trust to provide accommodation for the plaintiff's lifetime. However, such a claim does not create a caveatable interest and requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success and balance of convenience for an injunction to prevent the sale of the property."

    "question": "How does the court handle costs in possession proceedings when the defendant claims a proprietary estoppel but fails to substantiate the claim?",
    "answer": "In the case of *Theocharous v Theocharous [2025] NSWSC 45*, the court applied the general rule that costs follow the event (UCPR Rule 42.1) when the defendant failed in both the possession proceedings and the proprietary estoppel claim (p_num: 63). The court ordered that the defendant pay the costs of the possession proceedings (p_num: 37).",
    "contexts": [
      "In the end, the simple fact is that Harris failed in the possessionproceedingsand he failed in his proprietary estoppel claim. It is straightforward of applying the general rule that costs follow the event (UCPRRule 42.1).",
      "If counsel were correct in submitting that the making of the possession claim was in some way unwarranted, then it would hardly seem satisfactory for Andrew\u2019s costs of bringing that claim to fall on the estate at all. Rather, the appropriate costs order would beforAndrewpersonally to bear thecosts of the claim. But I do not think that counsel\u2019s submission is correct.",
      "At adirectionshearingat the end oflast year I intimated that the possession proceedings(including the proprietary estoppel cross-claim)would probably be heard first.But in the event, there was little dispute about those proceedings (except as to costs), and I was able to dispose of them on the first dayof the allocated hearing. The family provision proceedings were,however, unable to go ahead because of the late service of evidence. They have been adjourned.",
      "As already mentioned, the possession proceedings were managed and prepared for trial alongside the family provision proceedings. The result is that there will inevitably have been some overlap between the costs of the two proceedings. The costs will fall into three categories: (1)costs solely referable to the family provision proceedings; (2)costs solely referable to the conduct of the possession proceedings; and (3)costs common, in the sense of beingequally attributable,toboth proceedings.",
      "I do not accept Anthony\u2019s submission that issues of estoppel were significantand separate from whetherAnthony signed the Deed.Charbel\u2019s pleaded case was that Anthony was bound by an estoppel bydeed.However,suchan estoppel only operates in an action on the deed, a claim not brought in these proceedings:Judgmentat [189]. No meaningful issue of estoppel arose on the facts. Rather, the Deed amounted to an agreement between the brothers which rescinded any former agreement and upon which Charbel could rely:Judgment at[191]-[202].Therefore, I do not accept that there was a real separate issue of estoppel as Anthony has suggested in order to resist indemnity costs."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "In possession proceedings where the defendant claims a proprietary estoppel but fails to substantiate the claim, the court typically orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs, following the general rule that costs follow the event (UCPR Rule 42.1). If the defendant's claim is abandoned or dismissed due to lack of evidence, the court may also consider the defendant's conduct, such as failing to lodge or extend a caveat, or not seeking an injunction, as factors justifying the costs order. Additionally, if the plaintiff made a valid offer of compromise that was more favorable than the judgment, the court may award indemnity costs from the date of the offer's expiry."

One factor that may warrant granting a stay is extreme personal hardship to the taxpayer who is called upon to pay.

    ],
    "ground_truth": "The court will only grant a stay on recovery actions sparingly. Key considerations include whether the recovery action will stultify the applicant's ability to trade, the completeness of the applicant's financial evidence, the strength of the applicant's case against the tax liability, and whether the applicant has made any voluntary payments or arrangements to reduce the liability. The statutory scheme allows the Commissioner to recover debts independently of the objection or review process, and the court will not lightly interfere with this legislative policy."

This notice was revoked on 19 November 2024 (\u201cthe Revoked Notice\u201d) and replaced by an updated notice.",
      "This matter came before me, at short notice, on 21 November 2024, in the Duty List. It was before the Court by way of summons, filed that day by Ms Stuart on behalf of Rising Tide, a community activist movement particularly concerned with climate change, against the Minister for Transport for the State of New South Wales. Rising Tide was intending to hold a3 dayevent in Newcastle (which was part of a longer 10 day event covering both Newcastle and Canberra) in relation to which the Minister had gazetted a Notice. The Notice was due to come into effect at 5:00pm that dayandpurportedto exclude vessels and people from a large area of the waters of Newcastle Harbour and offshore, called an exclusion zone. If valid and effective, this Notice would have effectively excluded from the zone the conduct of water-based activities planned by Rising Tide over the ensuing three days.",
      "Counsel for the Minister then contended that if a s 12 notice meant that an organiser could not hold the event they wanted to have, they could change the eventin order tohave it fall outside the Exclusion Zone. The evidence in relation to the availability of the boat ramp upriver and the offshore beaches was referred to. An example was given that s 12 would permit the Minister to declare an exclusion zone such that the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race participants were not permitted to go into a particular part of Sydney Harbour because there were going to be other vessels moving around. I did not find this example (nor another one given in oral submissions) analogous to the situation before me, and thus not useful. The Sydney to Hobart example was premised on the existence of a special event, being the Sydney to Hobart race, being allowed to proceed in essentially the same way\u2013that is, to sail from Sydney to Hobart.",
      "As to the final submission made by the Minister that the Notice did not make entering the Exclusion Zone unlawful, but rather that an offence was only committed if a person contravened a direction by an authorised officer, and thus the jurisdictional fact was not established, this submission was not made good. Clearly, the issuing of the Notice is a critical step in establishing an exclusion zone. Section 12(3) is expressed in terms of the Minister excluding vessels and people. The question of how an exclusion zone is enforced is not relevant to the question of the Minister\u2019s power to declare such a zone."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "The legal grounds for challenging the validity of a marine exclusion zone notice under the Marine Safety Act 1998 (NSW) include arguing that the notice exceeds the powers granted by section 12 of the Act. Specifically, the notice must be predicated on the existence of a special event on water, and its purpose should be to facilitate the safe conduct of that event, not to prohibit it. If the notice effectively excludes the special event it purports to regulate, it may be declared invalid and of no legal effect."

      "First, a plain reading of s 12 of the Act, which provides a power to restrict vessels and people from specified navigable waters, indicates that any exercise of the power pre-supposes the carrying out of a special event on the water, with a view to safely regulating and thereby facilitating such an event. Not only is this obvious from a reading of the section as a whole,Inote in particular that s 12(1) provides\u201cIn this section,special eventmeans a major race for vessels or other event that may affect the safety of navigation in any particular waters\u201d; and further note the words\u201cduring a special event\u201din s 12(2) and\u201cduring the event concerned\u201din s 12(3). Although no event was specified in the Notice,taking into accountall of the circumstances, I came to the view that the effect of the Notice which purported to establish an exclusion zone, was, paradoxically, to exclude (rather than facilitate) the particular special event in relation to which the Notice was issued, that is, the planned Rising Tide water-based activities.",

It can be remembered that a\u201cspecial event\u201dis defined in s 12(1) as\u201ca major race for vessels or other event that may affect the safety of navigation in any particular waters\u201d. This definition cannot realistically encompass events on land. The terms of subsections (2) and (3) reinforce the water-based nature of a special event. The argument, therefore, that the Exclusion Zone merely regulates rather than extinguishes the event, given that most of it is on land, must fail.",
      "As to the additional submission in relation to futility, it was contended thatwhether or notthe Notice was set aside, the event would be unlawful because it was an unlicensed aquatic activity.

The building order was limited to those matters dealing with fire safety. There is nothing on the Council file which indicates that the Council was aware of or had general concerns about the overall condition of the property at least until its inspection in 2017.This is not a case in which theCouncil had direct knowledge of the very poor condition ofthecommercial premises.

    "question": "Can a plaintiff claim psychological injury damages in a solicitor negligence case involving a commercial property purchase?",
    "answer": "In the case of S&P Gomes Pty Ltd ta Cohuna Hotel Motel v Sundar ta Sun Legal [2025] NSWSC 24, the court stated that it is not appropriate for a legal practitioner who fails to advise on the terms of a contract for the purchase of land and a business to be liable for a psychological injury. The psychological injury in this case first developed some years after the negligence of the legal practitioner and was said to be caused by a number of different factors (p_num: 278).",
    "contexts": [
      "I do not consider that it is appropriate for a legal practitioner who fails to advise on the terms of a contract for the purchase of land and a business to be liable for a psychological injury which first developed some years after the negligence of the legal practitioner and which is said, on first diagnosis8years after the conduct of the solicitor, to be caused by a number of different factors.",
      "In the present proceedings the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of negligence include that the defendants failed to obtain interlocutory orders to preventtwo ofthe directors of Optimisation from conducting a meeting on 29 April 2013 for the purpose of removing the plaintiff as a director; failed to take steps to obtain Optimisation\u2019s accounting records in a timely mannerandfailed to inform the plaintiff of an offer of compromise dated 28 June 2013 from the directors of Optimisation. The damages claimed include compensation for psychiatric illness, including Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Mood, Major Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. These disorders are alleged to have manifested themselves in an acute mental health breakdown on 26 November 2014 and in chronic cognitive and functional impairment.",
      "I accept thatMr Gomeshas developed psychological symptomsin the nature of depressionand associated conditions which are generally referable to the operation of the Cohuna Hotel Motel. In that sense, his psychological condition isreferableto the negligence of the first defendant. However, I do not accept thatMr Gomesis entitled to damages for personal injury for the following reason:",
      "InJune2020 Mr Atwal was injured in a motor vehicle accidentfor whichhelatermadea claimunder theMotor Accident Injuries Act 2017(NSW)forthephysical and psychological injurieswhich he suffered.The insurer accepted liability for the accident and Mr Atwalpursued damages fornon-economiclossresulting fromthe impairment caused byhis psychological injury.But his physical injuries,some ofwhich required surgery, havenot yetstabilised and so havenot been assessed.",
      "Mr Gomesclaims that he has suffered psychological and physical injury consequent upon the negligence of the defendants. These injuries are said to include anxiety and depression arising from financial stress, disrupted sleep, cervical pain, restriction of movement, loss of self-esteem, onset of high blood pressure, gout, and changes in personality."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "No, the court held that the solicitor's negligence in failing to advise on the property purchase did not extend to liability for psychological injury that developed years later. The causal link was deemed too tenuous, and such claims were not pleaded as standalone damages."

    "question": "Has a court addressed the issue of client legal privilege in the context of police seizing a legal practitioner\u2019s mobile phone under a search warrant, and what was the outcome?",
    "answer": "Yes, the court addressed the issue of client legal privilege in the context of police seizing a legal practitioner\u2019s mobile phone under a search warrant. The court found that the second warrant was invalid because it did not sufficiently identify what was being searched for and its connection with the searchable offences. The court ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s mobile telephone be returned to him (Johnson v Commissioner of New South Wales Police [2025] NSWSC 21, p. 167, 184, 210).",
    "contexts": [
      "These proceedings raise important issues regarding the issue and execution of search warrants to seize the personal mobile telephones of legal practitioners, in this case a solicitor.\u201cSmartphones\u201dwhich are capable of containing very large amounts of data, have been in use in Australia since 2007.A solicitor\u2019s mobile telephone can now contain a large number of documents including emails, annexures, file notes, briefs of evidence (as attachments or otherwise), letters, instructions, photographs and other documents over which a claim for privilege may be made. In that respect, seizing a solicitor\u2019s mobile telephone to search for documents is in many ways analogous to executing a search warrant to search their office.",
      "A significant factor in my consideration is that despite the fact that the phone (and its data) was temporarily in the possession of the Commissioner at the time the second warrant was executed, it was clearly the telephone of a practising solicitor. It would have been obvious to the second defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s phone would not just contain his own documents but also extensive documents relating to a large number of clients who would no doubt wish to make a claim for privilege in relation to the data on the phone before it was accessed.As Garling J observed inLee (No.3)at [168],although a claim of privilege does not make asearch warrant, without more, invalid, the relevant legal practitioner has a strict obligation to claim the privilege on behalf of their client, and to maintain such a claim. His Honour went on to observe that it can be \u201cconfidently anticipated\u201d that the relevant legal practitioner would refrain from voluntarily compliance with the search warrant on the basis that client legal privilege existed.",
      "A further unusual aspect in this case is that the seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s mobile telephone was not from his possession but rather from the possession of police. This raisesfurthercomplications.The parties were unable to identify any decisions addressing the degree of specificity required when a solicitor\u2019s telephone is seized from a third party; this is no doubt because it would be rare for a solicitor not tobe in possession of his or her mobile telephone at all times.",

    ],
    "ground_truth": "Yes. In Johnson v Commissioner of New South Wales Police [2025] NSWSC 21, the plaintiff, a solicitor, had his mobile phone seized under a search warrant. The Court considered the handling of client legal privilege, noting that the phone contained privileged client material. The Court ultimately found the warrant invalid and ordered the return of the mobile phone, recognizing the importance of protecting client legal privilege in such circumstances."

      "Unless parties and their legal practitioners can sensibly reduce the volume of materials to be provided to the Court and conduct interlocutory applications with appropriately proportionate costs, the time may come, if it has not already arrived, when the Court will have to take further decisive action to ensure the overriding purposes of civil litigation are met. This potentially includes limiting the volume of materials that are placed in the Court Book and capping the costs recoverable in respect of interlocutory applications. Of course, any such action would need to be done in a considered and informed way.",
      "My provisional view is that,in all the above circumstances, rather than reserve the question of costs, the appropriate order is that the costs orders agreed in respect of the two applications that have been the subject of proposed consent orders should be as proposed and that,in respect of the balance of the four applications,there should be no order as to costs to the intent that each of the parties should bear theiritscosts.",

    "ground_truth": "The starting point is Rule 42.7 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) which provides that unless the court orders otherwise, the costs of any application or step in proceedings, including reserved costs and costs where no order is made, are to be paid and dealt with in the same way as the general costs of the proceedings. This rule has been described as the 'starting point as to what the costs order is to be unless that outcome is displaced by a discretionary decision' as noted in Wilson v Gilles (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 658."

    "question": "What factors might a court consider when deciding whether parties should bear their own costs in interlocutory matters with mixed success?",
    "answer": "In the case of Topine v Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited (No 3) [2025] NSWSC 18, the court considered the following factors when deciding that each party should bear their own costs of the motions:\n*   Each party had a measure of success (p. 14, 16).\n*   It would not be fair to the party who is ultimately unsuccessful in the proceedings to bear all the successful party\u2019s costs of those motions (p. 14).\n*   The trial judge, who did not hear the motions, would have a more difficult time modifying a general costs order in relation to the costs of the motion where the parties\u2019 success on the motions has been mixed (p. 14).\n*   The court considered that it was more consistent with efficiency that the judge who heard the motions should make the costs order (p. 14).",
    "contexts": [
      "The defendants submitted that the plaintiff\u2019s motion resulted in a mixed outcome being approximately equal measures of success. In those circumstances, the defendants submitted that each party should bear their own costs.",
      "However, the question of payment forthwith does not arise because of the view I have reached. Given the mixed success enjoyed by both sides in the dispute, I consider that the appropriate order is that each of the parties should bear their own costs of both motions.",

      "Their Lordshipsaccepted that whether the common costs shouldhavefollowedthe claim, or thecross-claim, or should have been apportioned between the two claims,hadbeen a matter forthe discretion of the trial judge. But as a matter of interpretation of the trial judge\u2019s order, the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s claim carried with it the common costs, so that the defendant was liable solelyfor the costsreferable to its unsuccessfulcross-claim."
    ],
    "ground_truth": "As demonstrated in Topine v Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited (No 3) [2025] NSWSC 18, the court considers factors such as: whether each party had a measure of success on the motions; fairness to the party who might ultimately be unsuccessful in the proceedings; the difficulty for a trial judge (who did not hear the motions) to modify a general costs order where parties' success was mixed; and consistency with the efficiency demanded by s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). The court in that case noted that 'where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings, the question of apportionment is very much a matter of discretion, and mathematical precision is illusory.'"
