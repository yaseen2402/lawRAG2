Mr Livingstone is the liquidator (Liquidator) of South West Radiology Pty Ltd (in liq) (Company), which is the trustee of the Trust. In addition, the Receiver seeks orders that:the Receiver be removed as a party to thePartnership Proceeding,and the Liquidator be joined as fourth defendant;the requirement for filing and passing of final accounts be dispensed with as against the Receiver;the remuneration of the Receiver be fixed in a specified amount, from 17 August 2022 up to the date of his retirement; andthis remuneration and the Receiver’s costs of the application be paid out of certain funds held in Court, whichthe Court has previously determined to be owing tothe Trust.The Receiver sought an order, which was not opposed, thathisapplication which was filedthe Partnership Proceedingbe taken ashaving been filed in a related proceeding in this Court, 2018/00381397 (Winding-up Proceeding)(together, theProceedings).The Liquidator appeared on theReceiver’sapplication and confirmed that he consented to the proposed appointmentas receiver and manager of the property, assets and undertaking of the Trust and consented to his joinder to the Partnership Proceeding. Each of the parties to thetwo Proceedings consented to theorders sought by the Receiver, with the exception of Dr Segal,whowas self-representedandwhoopposed certain orders being made.I address the particular issues raised by Dr Segal below.Relevant backgroundThe background tothis applicationcan be briefly stated.ThetwoProceedingsconcern disputes arising out ofa business that was conducted by three specialist radiologists. Initially, the business was conducted in partnership by Dr Segal and Dr Sharma(theSegal Sharma Partnership).Subsequently,they formed a partnership with Dr Chen(theSegal Sharma Chen Partnership).In June 2018,Dr Segal commencedthe Partnership Proceedingagainst Dr Sharma and Dr Chen, seeking the appointment of receivers to the twoPartnershipsand a partnership accounting.In the Partnership Proceeding, orders were made appointing receivers, andrequiringthe receivers to dispose of the assets of the twoPartnerships, to discharge their liabilities, and then to pay the net proceeds intoCourt. Those steps were implemented and moneys were paid into Court in the Partnership Proceeding (being net proceeds of $2,845,025.93 in respect of the Segal Sharma Partnership and $596,655.80 in respect of the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership). Substantial moneys remain held in Court in the Partnership Proceeding.The accounting aspects of the Partnership Proceeding were referred out to a referee for determination. As noted below, there was a substantial dispute about the adoption of the referee’s report.In December 2018,Dr Sharma commencedthe Winding-Up Proceeding, in which he sought the winding up of the Company.The Company’s activities were limited to acting as trustee of the Trust. In that proceeding, winding-up orders were made.Mr Preiner was, by orders made on 20 May 2019,appointed both as liquidator of the Company and as Receiver of the Trust. However,on 17 September 2019,he was replaced as liquidator of the Company byMr Livingstone, following a vote by creditors.Since that time, different persons have held the roles of liquidator of the Company and of receiver of the Trust.There are two prior judgments of the Court in the Proceedings which are of particular importance for this application.First, on 27 April 2022, Slattery J delivered a judgment inthe Partnership Proceeding:Segal v Sharma & Anor[2022] NSWSC 496.This judgment addressedthedispute between the parties concerningthe adoption ofthereferee’s report.The referee’sreportaddressed, among other things,the issue ofwhat moneys wereowingas between thetwo Partnerships and the Trust. Dr Segalwas represented by counsel atthis hearing and made submissions on these issues.On27 June 2022,Slattery J made ordersthat the referee’s report be adopted in a manner consistent with the declarations in paragraph 4 of those orders, which included the following:“4.The Court declares that:Segal Sharma Chen Partnership….(b)The Segal Sharma Chen Partnership owes South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust the sum of $149,716, subject to any set-off that might be determined.(c)South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust owes the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership the sum of $40,000, subject to any set-off that might be determined.…Segal Sharma Partnership(f)The Segal Sharma Partnership owes South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust the sum of $484,000, subject to any set-off that might be determined.(g)South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust owes the Segal Sharma Partnership the sum of $382,745, subject to any set-off that might be determined.”The effect of those declarationswasthat, irrespective ofhowthe issue of set-offwas resolved, it was determined that:the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership owed at least $109,716 to the Trust (being the difference between the amounts specified in declarations 4(b) and 4(c)); andthe Segal Sharma Partnership owedat least $101,255 tothe Trust (being the difference between the amounts specified in declarations 4(f) and 4(g)).I will refer to those amountsas the “UndisputedSums”.Justice Slattery also made ordersthat:theReceiverwasto file andservein the two Proceedings an application for determination of his remuneration both as Receiver and(up to17 September 2019) as liquidator of the Company;andas part ofthe remunerationapplication, the Receivercouldapply for the remuneration to be paid out of thefunds held in Court (being the net proceeds from the sale of the assets of the two Partnerships).The orders also included the following note:“12.The Court notes that it is the intention of the Court that if:(a)the Remuneration Application is approved; and(b)the liquidator consents to being granted all of the powers held by the third defendant as receiver;then:(c)the third defendant is to retire from its office as receiver and manager of the property, assets and undertaking of the SWR Holding Unit Trust; and(d)the liquidator is to be given all of the powers previously held by the third defendant as receiver and will have liberty to apply for access to the funds held in Court for the purpose of covering his reasonable expenses in determining the question in order 13 below.”Secondly, on 17 August 2022,Black Jdelivered judgmentin respect of the Receivers’remuneration applicationthat was made, in accordance with Slattery J’s orders, in both of the Proceedings:Segal v Sharma; In the matter of South West Radiology Pty Ltd[2022] NSWSC 1196.Dr Segalwas also represented by counsel at that hearingand made submissions onthe Receiver’sapplication.Black Jfixedthe amount of theReceiver’sremuneration, anddeterminedthat those moneys should be paid out of the moneysheld in Courtin the Partnership Proceedings. His Honour noted(at [4])that;“There is also no dispute between the parties [including Dr Segal] as to the extent to which the relevant monies may be paid out of Court, in a manner which properly recognises that no more should be paid out of Court thanreflectsthe entitlements of the Company and the Trust to monies paid into Court …”.His Honour noted (at [9]) that the evidence before the Court established that“a portion ofthosemonies [held in Court in the Partnership Proceedings], but not all of them, reflected funds to which the Trust, or the Company in its capacity as trustee of the Trust, was entitled in payment of debts owed by other associated entities or trusts”.Accordingly,on 17 August 2022,his Honour made thefollowingordersin the Winding-up Proceedingregarding the payment of Receiver’s approved remuneration from the moneys held in Court:“4.Note that, pursuant to Orders 4(b), (c), (f) and (g), and Order 5 and 6, made on 27 June 2022, the funds in court in proceedings 2018/00190679 [the Partnership Proceeding]include the following sums:(a)The sum of $109,716 which is payable by the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership to South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding UnitTrust.(b)The further sum of $40,000, the entitlement to which, as between Segal Sharma Chen Partnership and South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust, is yet to be determined.(c)The sum of $101,255 which is payable by the Segal Sharma Partnership to South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust.(d)The further sum of $382,745, the entitlement to which, as between Segal Sharma Partnership and South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) as trustee for the SWR Holding Unit Trust, is yet to be determined.5.Note that in consequence of these orders, the Court will make orders in proceedings 2018/190679 [the Partnership Proceeding]that:(a)The sum of $154,796.68 be paid out of court to the third defendant as follows:(i)as to 50%, being the sum of $77,398.34, from the funds held in court in relation to the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership, in part payment of the sum referred to in paragraph 4(a); and(ii)as to 50%, being the sum of $77,398.34, from the funds held in court in relation to the Segal Sharma Partnership, in part payment of the sum referred to in paragraph 4(c).(b)The third defendant be permitted to apply the sums in subparagraph (a) in payment of the sums approved in orders 1 to 3 made on 17 August 2022 in proceedings 2018/381397 and towards his proper expenses and disbursements.”On the same date, Black J made an order in thePartnershipProceeding in the termsset outin order 5 above. His Honour also made an order that the Receiver’s costs of the remuneration application“be paid out of the assets of the Trust”.Pursuantto the orders made by Black J on 17 August 2022, each of theUndisputedSums–being the amountswhich had been determined by Slattery Jto be owing byeach ofthePartnershipsto the Trust(irrespective ofhowany issue of set-offwas resolved)–has been reduced by $77,398.34.Theremaining balance of theUndisputed Sums, following those payments,is:an amount of $32,317.66 owing by the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership to the Trust; andan amount of $23,847.66 owing by the Segal Sharma Partnership to the Trust.(RemainingUndisputedSums)Retirement and replacement of ReceiverThe Receiver sought orders providing for his retirement, for his replacement by the Liquidator, and for the Liquidator to be joinedtothe Partnership Proceeding as fourth defendant.Dr Segal did not oppose those orders, and the other parties (as well as the Liquidator) consented to those orders being made.Those orders should be made. As I have set out above, it was the Court’s intention, expressed inthe note set out in the Court’s orders made by Slattery J which is quoted above, that if the remuneration applicationof the Receiverwas approved and if theLiquidator consented to being granted all of the powers held by the Receiver (both of which have occurred), then the Receiverwasto retire from his office as receiver and manager of the property of the Trust and the liquidatorwasto be given all powers previously held by the Receiver.The proposed orders give effect to that intention.Final accountsThe Receiver sought an order, under rule 26.5(1) of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules2005 (NSW), that the requirements under rules 26.5(2) and (3) for the filing and passing of final accounts be dispensed with against the Receiver.The basis for this application may be shortly stated.First, the Receiver deposed that the only assets of the Trust are the amounts owed to it by the two Partnerships. The only assets of the Partnerships are the funds held in Court.Secondly, the Receiver has prepared a receipts and payments report in respect of the receivership of the Trust. It shows that:the only payments which have been made into the receivership account, other than interest, have been funds paid out of Court pursuant to the orders made by Black J andbusiness activity statement (BAS)refunds from the AustralianTaxationOffice; andthe only payments which have been made from those funds are the payment of the remuneration that was approved by Black J and legal fees.Against that background, the Receiver submitted that any requirement for final accounts to be prepared would lead to costs being incurred, with no material benefit.All parties, other than Dr Segal, consented to the proposed order. The only basis which was identified by Dr Segal in his written submissions for opposing this order was that:“Accounts are required to justify the claim by the receiver of the trust against the Partnership funds in Court”.I do not accept this submission. The only claim made by theReceiver is for his remuneration and his costs of this application. Those are matters which can be determined bythe Courtwithout any need foranyfinal accountsto be prepared.Further, the only claim made by the Receiver“against the Partnership funds in Court”is a claim that, insofar as his remuneration is approved and costs are awarded, those moneys should be paid out of theRemaining Undisputed Sums which, having regard to the terms of the declarations made by Slattery J, represent moneys which have been determined by this Court to be owing to theTrust.It is not necessary for accounts to be prepared in order for this issue to be addressed (which is dealt with below).Giventhe matters I have outlined above,I consider thatthe requirement to prepare final accounts would lead to costs being incurred without any material benefit, and therefore I will make an order dispensing with the need for such accounts to be filed and passed.Fixing of RemunerationBlack J previously made orders on 17 August 2022 fixing the amount of the Receiver’s remuneration from 27 June 2022 to his retirement,in the amount of $8,800.00 inclusive of GST.The Receiver now seeks orders approving remuneration in addition to that amount:for the periodfrom17 August 2022 to 21 April 2024,in the amount of $20,675.60 inclusive of GST;andfor the periodfrom22 April 2024 to his retirement from office,in the amount of $12,012.00 inclusive of GST.The significance of the date 21 April 2024 is that, at the time the Receiver prepared his affidavit in support of this application, he had historical figures fortime expended on the matter (and the cost of such time)up to 21 April 2024, andprovided estimates for the time (and the costs of such time) likely to be requiredfor the period through to his retirement as Receiver.The parties other than Dr Segal consented to the proposed orders in relation to the Receiver’s remuneration. Dr Segal did not advance any submissions regarding the quantum of the remuneration or regarding whether such remuneration should be approved. Instead, his opposition was to the proposed order that this amount be paid from the funds held in Court.I deal with that issue below.The principles relating to the approval of a receiver’s remuneration were not in dispute.Section 60-5 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations)(theIPSC)set out in Schedule 2 to theCorporations Act 2001(Cth)(theAct)provides that an external administrator of a company is entitled to receive remuneration for necessary work properly performed by the external administrator in relation to the external administration, in accordance with the remuneration determinations (if any) for the external administrator.Section 60-10 of the IPSCprovides that remuneration determinations may be made by, inter alia, the Court. Section 60-10(4) provides that, if a determination under this section specifies that the external administrator is entitled to receive remuneration worked out wholly or partly on a time-cost basis, the determination must include a cap on the amount of remuneration worked out on a time-cost basis that the external administrator is entitled to receive.In determining the amount of such remuneration, the Court must have regard to the matters specified in section 60-12, namely:Matters to which the Court must have regardIn making a remuneration determination under paragraph 60-10(1)(c) or (2)(b), or reviewing a remuneration determination under section 60-11, the Court must have regard to whether the remuneration is reasonable, taking into account any or all of the following matters:(a)the extent to which the work by the external administrator was necessary and properly performed;(b)the extent to which the work likely to be performed by the external administrator is likely to be necessary and properly performed;(c)the period during which the work was, or is likely to be, performed by the external administrator;(d)the quality of the work performed, or likely to be performed, by the external administrator;(e)the complexity (or otherwise) of the work performed, or likely to be performed, by the external administrator;(f)the extent (if any) to which the external administrator was, or is likely to be, required to deal with extraordinary issues;(g)the extent (if any) to which the external administrator was, or is likely to be, required to accept a higher level of risk or responsibility than is usually the case;(h)the value and nature of any property dealt with, or likely to be dealt with, by the external administrator;(i)the number, attributes and conduct, or the likely number, attributes and conduct, of the creditors;(j)if the remuneration is worked out wholly or partly on a time - cost basis--the time properly taken, or likely to be properly taken, by the external administrator in performing the work;(k)whether the external administrator was, or is likely to be, required to deal with one or more controllers, or one or more managing controllers;(l) if:(i)a review has been carried out under Subdivision C of Division 90 (review by another registered liquidator) into a matter that relates to the external administration; and(ii)the matter is, or includes, remuneration of the external administrator;the contents of the report on the review that relate to that matter;(m)any other relevant matters.Those matters overlap with the matters which have traditionally been taken into account in assessing an insolvency practitioner’s remuneration, as summarised by Black J inReSakrNominees Pty Ltd[2017] NSWSC 668 at [23]-[25]:“A liquidator is entitled to reasonable remuneration for his or her services and the liquidator bears the onus of establishing that the amount of remuneration they seek is fair and reasonable and, in determining a liquidator’s reasonable remuneration, the Court will have regard to the factors specified in s 473(10) of the Corporations Act, to which I refer further below. The Court must bring an independent mind to bear on the question whether the remuneration sought by a liquidator is fair and reasonable; the liquidator must lead evidence in sufficient detail that the Court can determine that question; and the Court will generally need to be provided with an account in itemised form, setting out at least the details of the work done; the persons who did the work; the time taken to perform the work; the remuneration claimed; and, to the extent relevant, the expenses incurred by the liquidator:Venetian Nominees Pty Ltd vConlan(1998) 20 WAR 96 at 102–103. Proportionality is an important matter in considering the question of whether remuneration is reasonable, and the‘value’of a liquidator’s work can include the benefit of resolving the position of creditors and beneficiaries; the benefit to the community of not permitting assets to remain unproductively in the hands of a defunct company for a long period; and can include work that was required to be done, although it did not result in a return to creditors:Thackrayv Gunns Plantations Ltd[2011] VSC 380; (2011) 85 ACSR 144 at [64];Macks vMaka[2015] SASC 200; (2015) 110 ACSR 279 at [52]–[66];Warner, Re GTLTradeupPty Ltd (in liq)[2015] FCA 323; (2015) 104 ACSR 633 at [70]–[71];Templeton v Australian Securities and Investments Commission[2015] FCAFC 137; (2015) 108 ACSR 545.Most decisions in both State Supreme Courts and in the Federal Court of Australia have applied time costing as at least the starting point for a calculation of remuneration, although those decisions also emphasise the need for proportionality between the cost of the work done and the value of the services provided:Venetian Nominees Pty Ltd vConlanabove;Templeton v Australian Securities and Investments Commissionabove;Warner, Re GTLTradeupPty Ltd (in liq)above. There has been a degree of concern as to time-based remuneration, over a considerable period, although it must be accepted that remuneration on that basis is now more common....InSanderson, as liquidator ofSakrNominees Pty Ltd (in liq) vSakrabove, Bathurst CJ (with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) observed (at [54]) that the onus is on a liquidator to establish that the remuneration claimed is reasonable, and it is the Court’s function to determine that remuneration by considering the material provided to it and bringing an independent mind to bear on the relevant issues; that many of the factors specified in s 473(10) of the Corporations Acthave the concept of proportionality as an underlying theme, and that concept is an important consideration in determining whether remuneration is reasonable, so that the work done must be proportionate to the difficulty and importance of the task in the context in which it needs to be performed (at [55]); and that the fact that work does not increase the funds available for distribution to creditors or contributories does not mean that the liquidator is not entitled to be remunerated for it, where it was reasonable to carry out that work and the amount charged is reasonable (at [57]–[58])....”The Receiver also referred to the following observations of Black J inBlack Lab Design Pty Ltd (in liq) as trustee for the Black Lab Unit Trust[2023] NSWSC 661 at [6]-[7]:“The Court will apply an independent mind to whether the remuneration sought by an external administrator relates to necessary work which is properly performed, having regard to considerations of proportionality, but it is not the Court's function to undertake a line by line review of the costs claimed, including by reference to narratives in time schedules, and the Court will review the evidence in a broad way to satisfy itself that the amount claimed isreasonable:Re Banksia Securities Ltd (in liq) (recs andmgrs apptd)[2017] NSWSC 540 at [48]; Knox v Nile [2022] NSWSC 638 at [35].These principles have also been applied in assessing the remuneration of a Court appointed receiver, such as Mr Cook, in decisionsincluding Ide v Ide(2004) 184 FLR 44; [2004] NSWSC 751 at [39]ff andRe Metal Storm Ltd[2015] NSWSC 1699 at [11], Re Wine National Pty Ltd[2016] NSWSC 4 at [13];Re Banksia Securities Ltd (in liq) (recs and mgrs.apptd)[2018] NSWSC 229 at [5]ff.…”I have reviewed the evidence advanced in support of the Receiver’s application for remuneration in the sums proposed.I am satisfied as to the following matters.First, when the previous orders were made by Black J on 17 August 2022, it was not foreseen that, two years later, the Receiver would remain in office and would haveperformed significant workin the intervening period. Theincreaseddelay and cost, beyond what was anticipated at the time of the application before Black J,are primarily explained by two matters:Dr Segaldidnot agree tofixa sum for the Receiver’s costs of the remuneration application before Black J (despite all other parties being willing tofixa sum for those costs), resulting ina protracted costs assessment process; andDr Segaldidnot consent to the orders soughtby the Receiverin this application(in circumstances where all other parties consented to those orders), resultingin correspondenceextendingover a period,following which steps were taken to bring and pursuethe current application.Secondly, the Receiver has kept time records of all work done. I have reviewed the evidence and am satisfied that the work which has been done relates to the receivership. For example, the tasks undertaken include:work in respect of the costs assessment application, including liaising with the Receiver’s solicitors, reviewing documents from the costsassessor and reviewing correspondence from the parties in respect of the costs assessment;conferring with the Receiver’s solicitors regarding correspondence and draft orders to the parties regarding the Receiver’s retirement and reviewing correspondence form the parties in respect of the draft orders; andpreparing remuneration reports for this application, reviewing the draft affidavit and notice of motion for this application, and liaising with the Receiver’s solicitors in relation to the application.As the Receiver is a sole practitioner, and does not currently employ any staff, he charges differential rates for his time based upon the nature of the work being performed.As I have noted, there is no suggestion by Dr Segal that excessive work has been done, or excessive amounts have been charged.Nor did I discern, from my review of material included in the exhibit to the Receiver’s affidavit, any basis for any such criticism.Having regard to those matters, I am satisfied that the remuneration of the Receiver should be fixed in the amounts specified in the Receiver’sapplication.Costs of the applicationThe Receiver sought an order that the costs of his application be paid on an indemnity basis out of the assets of the Trust.Dr Segal did not advance any reason why the Receiver should not have his costs of the application. Instead,Dr Segalopposed the order on the basis that there are no assets of the Trust. I address this issue below.Each of the other parties consented to the proposed order for costs.The application has properly been broughtby the Receiver, and is in accordance with the Court’s intention stated inthe noteto the orders made by Slattery Jwhich has been set out above.In circumstances where Dr Segal would not consent to the proposed orders, it was necessary for the application to be brought. The Receiver is entitled to an order for his costs.In addition, the Plaintiffs in the Winding-up Proceedings (Dr Sharma and a corporation controlled by him) sought an order that their costs be paid out of theassets of the Trust. It was appropriate for Dr Sharma to take an active role on theReceiver’sapplication. AlthoughDr Sharmaconsented to the substance of the relief sought by the Receiver, he proposed a number ofsignificantamendments to the proposed orders, and advanced submissions as to why those amendments should be made, which were largely accepted by the Receiver and which have been reflected in the form of orders that were ultimately sought on the application.No party opposed the order sought by Dr Sharmafor costs,and I am satisfied that it shouldalsobe made.Payment of remuneration and costs from moneys held in CourtTheReceiver sought an order that thebalance of the Remaining Undisputed Sums (totalling $56,165.32)be paid out ofthe moneys held in Court in the Partnership Proceedingto the Receiver, andbe applied by the Receiver to pay his approved remuneration and costs,with the balance then being paid to the Liquidator (whowillassume the powers of the Receiverin respect of the assets of the Trust).As noted above, theRemainingUndisputedSumsrepresentamountswhich this Court has determined and has declared are owing by thetwoPartnerships to the Trust(irrespective of how any issue of set-off is resolved).All parties other than Dr Segal consented to the proposed orders. Dr Segal opposed the orders ontwo main bases, which he advanced in his written and oral submissions.First,Dr Segalsubmitted that the Trust Deed referred to the trust being established on the payment of an amount of $101.00 by the settlor. He asserted that this money wasnotpaid, and therefore theTrust wasnotestablished. On this basis, he argued that there could be no assets of the Trust, and any property which was claimed to be property of the Trust was in fact property of the Company.Secondly, andbuildingon the first submission,Dr Segalcontended that by operation of s 471B of theAct, the Courtwas prevented from makingany orders in respect of“property of the Company”.These submissions may bedeal withbriefly.Dr Segal is estopped, in these Proceedings, from raising any issue that the Trust wasnotcreatedor that the Trust is not owed any amounts by the two Partnerships.These Proceedings have been on foot for some 6 years, and Dr Segal has taken an active part in them.In particular,he was representedby counselat the hearing before Slattery J,advancingsubmissions regarding the question whether the referee’s report should be adoptedandidentifyingparticular matters in that report which were disputed. The referee’sreport found that certain sums were owingby each of the two Partnershipsto the Trust. Dr Segal did not, at that time, raise any issue that no sums could be owing to the Trust because it had not been created.Following that hearing, declarations were madeby this Court in the Partnership Proceedingthatspecifiedamounts were owed bythe twoPartnershipsto the Trust. Dr Segal did not appeal, or seek leavetoappeal, against those orders.Subsequently, Justice Black made orders in the two Proceedings that the Receiver’s remuneration be paid out of theUndisputed Sumswhich had been declared by the Court to be owing byeach ofthe two Partnerships to the Trust.Dr Segal was again represented bycounsel on this application. No submission was advanced on behalf of Dr Segalto the effect that no such order should be made because the Trust did not exist.In his reasons, Black J stated that a portion of the moneys held in Court in the Partnership Proceedings“reflected funds to which the Trust, or the Company in its capacity as trustee of the Trust, was entitled in payment of debts owed by other associated entities or trusts”. His Honour also made orders that the costs of the Receiver be paid out of the assets of the Trust. Dr Segal did not appeal, or seek leave to appeal, any of those orders.The Receiver now seeks orders in the Proceedings that his remuneration be paid out of the remaining undisputed balance of the moneys which this Court has declared to be owing by the Partnerships to the Trust.Given the matters outlined above, Dr Segal is estopped from raising, at this stage of the proceedings, any submission that no such amount is owing or that the Trust does not exist.The issue of the Trust’s entitlement to moneys owed by the two Partnerships isres judicata, by reason of the Court’s previous declarations in these Proceedings, and any issue regarding whether the Trust was created and exists would be at least the subject of anAnshunestoppel, given that it was an issue so relevant to the subject matter of the dispute before Slattery J in these Proceedings that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it:TimbercorpFinance Pty Ltd (in liq) v Collins;TimbercorpFinance Pty Ltd (in liq) v Tomes(2016) 259 CLR 212; [2016] HCA 44 at [56] per French CJ, Kiefel, Keane and Nettle JJ (with emphasis added by their Honours to a quotation fromPort of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd(1981) 147 CLR 589 at 602; [1981] HCA 45).In any event, it is notable that Dr Segal’s ownaffidavitevidenceindicatedthat an amountof $101.00 (beingthe sumstipulatedin the Trust Deed as the amount to be settled on the Trust)wastransferredon 24 April 2013 into theTrust’s bank account, with a notation of“settlement cheque”.Accordingly, even if Dr Segal were able to advance a submission that the Trust does not exist because the settlement sum was never paid, his own evidence fails to substantiate the factual basis for any such submission.It follows that Dr Segal is unable to contend (let alone establish) that the moneys which have been declared by this Court to be due to the Trust represent moneys to which the Company is beneficially entitled. Finally,and in any event,s 471Bdoes not limit the Court’s power to make orders in relation to property ofa company in liquidation, but instead stays a proceeding against thecompanyor in relation to the property ofacompany,or an enforcement process in relation to such property,except withtheleave of the Court.If leave were necessary(and it is not), it would have been grantedin the circumstances of this case,particularly given thatthe Receiver’s application has been brought in accordance with the orders made by Slattery J,whichprovided forthe Receivertobring an application for his retirement and replacement by the Liquidatorand, specifically, toseek orders that his remuneration be paid out of the moneys heldin Courtin the Partnership Proceedings.Conclusion and OrdersFor those reasons, I am satisfied that the orders soughtby the Receiverin the two Proceedingsshouldbe made, including an order forthe Receiver’scostsof this application.In addition, there should be an order for the costs of the Plaintiffs in the Winding-up proceeding to be paid out of the assets of the Trust.For those reasons, I make the following orders.In proceeding 2018/00381397 (the Winding-up Proceeding)Order that the Receiver’s notice of motion filed in proceedings 2018/00190679 on 2 May 2024 (Receiver’s Notice of Motion) be taken to have been filed in these proceedings.Following completion of the steps in Order 9, Adam Preiner (Receiver), appointed as receiver and manager over the property, assets and undertaking of the SWR Holding Unit Trust (Trust) pursuant to paragraph 3 of the orders made on 20 May 2019, shall immediately retire from office as receiver and manager.Immediately following the retirement of the Receiver pursuant to Order 2, Glenn Ian Livingstone in his capacity as liquidator of South West Radiology Pty Ltd (ACN 106 041 007) be appointed as receiver and manager over the property, assets and undertaking of the Trust and be granted all of the powers previously held by the Receiver as receiver and manager, being the powers recited in s 420 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Act) as if the reference in s 420 to“property of the corporation”were a reference to“property of the Trust”, together with the powers that a liquidator has in respect of property of a company (in its role as legal owner and trustee) pursuant to s 477(2) of the Act including, without limitation, the power to do all things necessary or convenient to:distribute the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the Trust to any creditors of the Trust pursuant to s 556 of the Act; anddistribute any surplus thereafter to the beneficiaries of the Trustand has liberty to apply for access to the funds held in Court for the purpose of his reasonable expenses in determining the question in orders 5 and 6 of the orders made by Justice Slattery on 27 June 2022 in proceedings 2018/00190679.Pursuant to rule 26.5(1) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (UCPR), the requirements under rule 26.5(2) and rule 26.5(3) of the UCPR for the filing and passing of final accounts are dispensed with as against Receiver.The remuneration of the Receiver in his capacity as receiver and manager of the property, assets and undertaking of the Trust for the period 17 August 2022 to 21 April 2024 is fixed in the amount of $20,675.60 inclusive of GST.The remuneration of the Receiver in his capacity as receiver and manager of the property, assets and undertaking of the Trust for the period 22 April 2024 to his retirement from office is fixed in the amount of $12,012.00 inclusive of GST.Order that the Receiver’s costs of the Receiver’s Notice of Motion be paid on the indemnity basis out of the assets of the Trust.Note that the Court will make orders in proceedings 2018/190679 to the effect:That the sum of $56,165.32 be paid out of court to the Receiver as follows:the sum of $32,317.66 from the funds held in court in relation to the Segal Sharma Chen Partnership in discharge of the remaining balance of the sum referred to in paragraph 4(a) of the orders made on 17 August 2022 in proceedings 2018/381397 (17 August 2022 Orders);

A third issue arose, which I am satisfied ought to be determined, as to the effect of a purported removal of Mr Khan, the First Plaintiff, at a meeting held on 8 July 2024. Further issues are raised which have wider application, to which I will return below."}, {"p_num": 2, "text": "The proceedings were conducted in circumstances of considerable urgency where, at the time they were commenced, I was informed that the disputes amongst the members of the League, or at least its executive bodies, had the consequence that its bank accounts had been frozen and it would not be able to meet its ordinary expenditures. The Plaintiffs have since qualified that position but Mr Attia, who appears for several of the Defendants, today indicated that the matter remained urgent, because there were difficulties arising from a mortgage payment falling due. Mr Robertson, who appears for the Plaintiffs, responds that there is no evidence of that matter, and I accept that proposition, but I nonetheless proceed on the basis that the matter is urgent and requires an urgent judgment. In those circumstances, I will give an oral judgment, and I will determine only what is necessary to determine the issues in dispute. That will have the consequence that it will neither be necessary nor appropriate to reach findings as to the multitude of factual matters which are in dispute between individual witnesses in detailed affidavits. In any event, it may not have been possible to resolve those disputes, where none of those witnesses were cross-examined to seek to test the truth of their contradictory evidence."}, {"p_num": 3, "text": "I should note one other matter, by way of introduction. Mr Attia has purported to appear not only for the individual Defendants but also for the League. It is not apparent to me how he can have done so, in circumstances that it appears to be conceded by the Defendants that any meeting which resolved that the League should be represented was inquorate and therefore ineffective. I will, at the conclusion of this hearing, set in place orders to seek to establish whether, in fact, the League has paid fees referable to its purported representation in this matter, or is bound to do so, which would be a matter of substantial concern if there has been no proper corporate authority for it to do so."}, {"p_num": 4, "text": "Turning now to the matters in issue in the proceedings, I ordered Points of Claim (“POC”) and Points of Defence (“POD”) and a significant number of the matters in issue are resolved by the position taken in those documents. It is common ground (POC [1], POD [1]ff) that the League is governed by a Constitution adopted in March 2009, which is in evidence, and that the objects of the League are set out in cl 4 of that Constitution to which I have been taken. It is common ground that cl 11.3 of the Constitution makes provision for a body called the \"Shuraa Council\" which is to comprise seven financial members, who appoint persons to it to particular offices including the office of Chairman. It is common ground that the Constitution permits the appointment of alternate members who can fill a vacancy in the Shuraa Council at a meeting of the Shuraa Council. Clause 11.16 in turn sets out functions and duties of the Shuraa Council, and decisions of the Council are final and binding upon the League and its members."}, {"p_num": 5, "text": "Importantly, it is common ground that a quorum of a meeting of the Council is formed by five members, which may include alternate members but must include the Chairman or his representative. I read the reference to \"representative\" in that clause as a person appointed by the Chairman as his representative; it is not apparent to me that it can have any other possible meaning."}, {"p_num": 6, "text": "It is common ground that the Shuraa Council has the power to dissolve the Executive Committee and Executive Board or the League under cl 17.3 if, in the opinion of the Shuraa Council, that Executive Board and Executive Committee have failed to carry out their functions and duties in accordance with the objects enshrined in cl 4 of the Constitution."}, {"p_num": 7, "text": "It is common ground that several members of the League were appointed to the Shuraa Council at the 2023 annual general meeting of the League, and these included Mr Khan, and that, on or about 6 March 2023, Mr Khan was appointed as Chair of the Shuraa Council. There is a dispute, which becomes important for the resolution of these proceedings, as to whether Mr Khan was subsequently removed as Chair of the Shuraa Council at a meeting on 8 July 2024."}, {"p_num": 8, "text": "The POC and POD in turn addressed provisions in the Constitution of the League which establish a school conducted on the same premises as are occupied by the League. It is apparent, both from the POC and POD and from the evidence to which I have been taken, that there are issues as to the extent of the League's control over the school; those issues are contentious among its members; and the Commonwealth Department of Education has required the League and the school to address issues in that regard in order to retain continued funding for the school."}, {"p_num": 9, "text": "The POC and POD in turn plead events at a meeting of the Shuraa Council on 8 July 2024, and, importantly, the Plaintiffs contend and the Defendants deny that there was no constitutional power to remove the Chair from that meeting, if in fact he was removed, or to remove him from office, if in fact that occurred. The Plaintiffs also contend that, from the moment he was removed from, or possibly left, that meeting, the Shuraa Council did not satisfy its quorum requirements, and that meeting was no longer effective. Issues also arise as to subsequent meetings that purported to be meetings of the Shuraa Council on 18 July and 20 July 2024 and the question of the validity of those meetings depends in part upon whether Mr Khan had been removed as Chair of the Shuraa Council, in which case those meetings were plainly invalid, or whetherthose meetings comprised the Shuraa Council in its proper form, by contrast with an alternate Shuraa Council which had been established under the purported chairmanship of Dr Gaffar, one of the Defendants."}, {"p_num": 10, "text": "Each of the parties relied on numerous affidavits in the proceedings. The Plaintiffs read the affidavits dated 8 and 12 August 2024 of Mr Khan, and I note that Mr Khan's second affidavit addressed an issue as to the circumstances in which he had left the meeting that took place on 8 July 2024 and whether he had sought to appoint Mr Ud Dean as his representative at the time that he left that meeting. The Plaintiffs also read affidavits dated 12 August 2024 of Mr Jang, Mr Ali, Mr Ud Dean, Mr Afzal, Mr Manzoor. As I noted above, none of those witnesses were cross-examined, although there were significant differences between their evidence and the evidence of witnesses called by the Defendants, so there would be real difficulty in resolving factual disputes between the witnesses by the preference of the evidence of one witness for that of another, if it were not possible to determine the matters in dispute by reference largely to documentary evidence. In the event, the documentary evidence is sufficient to determine the matters in dispute in the proceedings."}, {"p_num": 11, "text": "The Defendants in turn rely on an affidavit dated 14 August 2024 of Mr Yasin, which, consistent with other evidence led in the proceedings, frequently leads evidence by way of assertion, for example, as to a challenge as to the notice given of a purported Shuraa Council meeting on 18 July 2024. Mr Yasin also refers to a purported meeting of the Shuraa Council on 20 July 2024 where he gives more direct evidence that he did not receive an agenda or notice of that meeting. The Defendants also read the affidavit dated 14 August 2024 of Mr Illiyas, who is currently the President of the Executive Committee of the League, a separate constitutional body within the League to the Shuraa Council, and who gives evidence, inter alia, of events preceding and at the meeting on 8 July 2024. An affidavit of Dr Gaffar dated 13 August 2024 in turn addresses events at significant length, but often in an inadmissible way, by reference to Mr Gaffer's perception as to how the League should operate, irrespective of the constitutional basis on which it was established. The Defendants in turn readaffidavit evidence of Mr Khan, Mr Dean and Mr Manzoor dated 14 August 2024 in reply, but the parties paid little attention to that reply evidence in submissions."}, {"p_num": 12, "text": "I first refer to the applicable principles, before turning to the terms of the Constitution of the League, which are of some significance to the matter. First, ordinary principles of construction are applied in construing a Constitution of an incorporated body such as the League, although caution will be exercised in drawing inferences from surrounding circumstances or having regard to extraneous materials, where a constitution is a statutory contract that is a public document and may be relied on by third parties:Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd(2006) 156 FCR 1; [2006] FCAFC 144 at [55]-[56], [124], [239]-[243];Echunga Football Club Inc v Hills Football League Inc(2014) 121 SASR 449; [2014] SASC 201 at [18]-[21];Australian Federation of Islamic Councils Inc v United Muslims of New South Wales Inc[2021] NSWCA 311 at [64];Re Baikal Sports Club Inc[2024] NSWSC 5 at [18], on which I have drawn for this summary."}, {"p_num": 13, "text": "Second, there is a significant body of authority which recognises that, where significant matters are to be raised at a general meeting of an incorporated body, fair notice needs to be given to members of those matters. The relevant decisions include the decision of Young J inJenashare Pty Ltd v Lemrib Pty Ltd(1993) 11 ACSR 345 at 348 and the several decisions reviewed by the Supreme Court of Tasmania inEsposito v The Wilderness Society Inc[2010] TASSC 21. I recognise that those principles do not apply, at least in their full form, to meetings of directors, as I noted in my decision inKeneally (as administrator of Australian Blue Mountain International Cultural and Tourist Group Pty Ltd)[2015] NSWSC 937 at [72]. Here, the Shuraa Council does not have the character of a board of directors and seems to me to be more in the nature of an oversight body of the League. I would not, in those circumstances, read down the notice requirements so that they do not apply to the proceedings of the Shuraa Council. Third, and importantly, it is well-established that powers of suspension that are conferred by the constitution of an incorporated body areto be construed narrowly and strictly in accordance with the terms of that body's constitution:Kabbara v Australian National Sports Club Inc[2020] NSWSC 497 at [39]."}, {"p_num": 14, "text": "Turning now to the terms of the League's Constitution, it is plain enough that, as Mr Robertson who appears for the Plaintiffs points out, that Constitution adopts a form that is unusual by the standards of incorporated bodies generally, reflecting a recognition of the role of the League within its community. The preamble refers to the relevance of Quran, and cl 4, to which I referred above, identifies a wide range of specific objects of the League, within the broader context of the promotion of the understanding of Islam among its members, the general Muslim community and Australian society. Those objects include religious objects and an educational object, which is relevant to the League's involvement with the school. Clauses 11 and following refer to the operation of the Shuraa Council, which is to be comprised of seven financial members of the League, including a Chairman (also known as the \"Ameer\") who has a long term of appointment, of some nine years, a Deputy Chair who has a seven-year term of appointment, and other persons holding offices and other members. Clause 11.21 provides for the manner in which decisions of the Shuraa Council shall be made and cl 11.22 provides that such a decision is final and binding on the League and its members."}, {"p_num": 15, "text": "As I noted above, cl 11.23 provides that any five members of the Shuraa Council which must include the Chairman (Ameer) or his representative shall constitute a quorum for a properly convened meeting of the Shuraa Council, and cl 11.24 provides that, if a quorum is not present, the meeting stands adjourned until such time as a quorum is present. Clause 11.35 provides that the Shuraa Council has power to discipline its members who in the opinion of the majority of the members are not fit to continue as a member of the Council or have acted in a manner that has brought disrepute to the Council or the League or have acted against the objects of the League and cl 11.37 provides that, as and when required, the Shuraa Council may determine that the Chairman shall stand aside in cases where he is \"deemed to have conflict of interest\"."}, {"p_num": 16, "text": "Two things should be noted about those clauses. The first is that they each require an opinion to have been formed, namely that the relevant member has conducted himself in a particular way and, in the case of the Chairman, that he is deemed to have \"conflict of interest\". Second, as a matter of the ordinary incidents of Australian law, the formation of that opinion, in a manner that is prejudicial to the person to whom the opinion is directed, will be subject to requirements of procedural fairness. Third, obviously enough, the exercise of those powers requires that the relevant opinion in fact has been formed after complying with those obligations of procedural fairness."}, {"p_num": 17, "text": "Clause 17.3 of the Constitution in turn provides that the Shuraa Council of the League has power to dissolve the Executive Board and Executive Committee if, in the opinion of the Shuraa Council, the Executive Board and Executive Committee have failed to carry out the function and duties of the League in accordance with its objects as enshrined in its Constitution. Again, that clause requires that a particular opinion has been formed, and an obligation of procedural fairness would attach to the process by which that opinion was formed. Appendix 4 in turn refers to the principles of consultation reflected in the concept of \"Sunnats of Mashwarah\", which govern the operations of the Shuraa Council and relevantly require that the Ameer present the meeting agenda that has to be discussed and request the opinions of others present."}, {"p_num": 18, "text": "Turning now to the relevant documentary evidence, it is apparent that, at least from 24 March 2023, the League has been in discussion with the Commonwealth Department of Education in respect of concerns as to its influence over the operation of the school, and steps that were required to be taken to address that matter, as a condition of continuing Commonwealth funding of the school. Those issues appear to have given rise to dispute amongst members of the League and, in particular, among members of the Executive Committee on the one hand and the Shuraa Council on the other."}, {"p_num": 19, "text": "Correspondence took place, in the period immediately prior to a Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024, as to the basis on which members of the Executive Committee and Executive Board would join a Shuraa Council meeting on that date and it appears to have been agreed that they could do so in order to present as to the position in respect of a suggested constitution, or at least issues as to consultation in respect of that constitution, which was intended to address the Commonwealth Department of Education's concerns as to the control of the school."}, {"p_num": 20, "text": "A significant contest then arises as to events at the meeting on 8 July 2024 which are recorded in minutes found in the evidence (Ex D1,117ff). At about 8pm on that date, some 17 members of the Executive Committee and Executive Board members joined the meeting, and there was then discussion initiated by Mr Khan as Chair, of issues as to the Constitution and, from about 8.25pm, the President of the League, Mr Illiyas, in turn addressed the meeting. Mr Illiyas then raised concerns as to the process and procedure of a previous investigation committee and as to \"another matter\", and insisted that those \"conflicted\" in respect of the investigation committee must leave the room. It must immediately be noted that this was an unusual, and it seems to me unsustainable, concept of a \"conflict\". The reference to those who were \"conflicted\" was, it seems, to those against whom allegations were to be made by Mr Illiyas. It is not apparent to me how, consistent with Australian law, a person would be“conflicted”and excluded from a meeting because an allegation is made against him or against her, which he or she may otherwise take the opportunity to answer. To the contrary, that person has not a disability, namely a conflict, but instead a right to be afforded procedural fairness in respect of the allegations that are made against him or her. The President then expanded upon his concerns, and it appears that Mr Khan and two other persons were persuaded to leave the room on the basis that they were \"conflicted\" because allegations were being advanced against them. The meeting then continued in Mr Khan's absence."}, {"p_num": 21, "text": "It is put by the Plaintiffs, and denied by the Defendants, that at this point Mr Khan had appointed another person to act as his representative as Chair, afterhe left the room. That would be consistent with the constitutional provisions to which I have referred above. However, the Defendants’position, and plainly the basis on which the meeting was conducted, was that instead Dr Gaffar would become the Chair of that meeting, apparently because there was some expectation that the Deputy Chair would do so which finds no basis in the League’s Constitution of the League."}, {"p_num": 22, "text": "That was the manner in which the meeting continued and, at that point, a significant number of further allegations were made against Mr Khan and others, to which Mr Attia, who appears for the Defendants, gives significant weight in submissions. Discussions continued and, at the conclusion of the meeting, resolutions passed were that Mr Khan and Mr Jang be stood down from the Shuraa Council indefinitely based on a number of serious allegations raised against them in matters relating to the Council and their involvement in the investigation committee; that the allegations against those two persons would be objectively investigated by the Shuraa Council, and a final determination would be made based on those findings; and that Dr Gaffar was now the Chair of the Shuraa Council, assuming this position from his previous position as Deputy Chair by virtue of the provisions of the League's Constitution."}, {"p_num": 23, "text": "Several things should be said about these resolutions. The first is that it is not apparent that the resolution that Messrs Khan and Jang be stood down from the Shuraa Council is sustainable on any basis. First, if the Defendants are correct that Mr Khan had not in fact appointed a representative to act as Chair in his absence, then the quorum for the Shuraa Council was not satisfied for the whole of the discussion that took place after Mr Khan's withdrawal from the meeting, because that quorum required the presence of Mr Khan, who had not resigned as Chair and had not then been removed as Chair. Second, the process which was adopted was wholly inconsistent with both notice requirements and procedural fairness requirements to which I have referred above. There was no notice that such a proposal would be raised at the meeting to allow persons attending fair notice of the matters that they were to be asked to address. Second, no procedural fairness was afforded to Mr Khan in respect of the allegations; to the contrary, he was invited to remove himselffrom the meeting, preventing him from having any opportunity to answer the allegations."}, {"p_num": 24, "text": "Third, the resolutions have the remarkable feature that the decision to stand down Mr Khan from the Shuraa Council comes first and the investigation of whether there is a basis for it would come second. That is not consistent with the terms of the Constitution which, so far as it includes disciplinary provisions extending to Mr Khan as Chair, provides that the Shuraa Council may determine that he stand aside where he is deemed to have \"conflict of interest\". The Shuraa Council here does not reach that decision, because it is apparent that the resolution it had passed contemplates a further investigation, before any decision as to the rights or wrongs of the allegations against Mr Khan is made. Second, if, contrary to that view, the Shuraa Council had made that decision, it was made without affording procedural fairness to Mr Khan. Further, for the reasons noted above, at least on the basis of the Defendants’position, and the manner on which that meeting was conducted, it was made while the meeting was inquorate, because Mr Khan was absent from it. Further, so far as the resolution contemplates that Dr Gaffar would become the Chair of the Shuraa Council, by virtue of the provisions of the League’s Constitution of the League, no such provision has been identified and it is not apparent that any such provision exists."}, {"p_num": 25, "text": "For these reasons, I am comfortably satisfied that the resolutions recorded at the conclusion of the minutes of the Shuraa Council meeting were void and that Mr Khan remains the Chair of the Shuraa Council."}, {"p_num": 26, "text": "Issues also arise in respect of subsequent meetings of the Shuraa Council on 18 July and 20 July 2024, by which time the parties had fallen into dispute. At the meeting on 18 July 2024, a Shuraa Council of which Mr Khan acted as Chair referred to what was described as a \"mutiny\" by the President and Shuraa members, presumably not extending to all members of the Shuraa Council. The Shuraa Council then unanimously resolved to stand down its secretary dueto an investigation regarding certain matters, but, consistent with the process adopted by its opponents, also did not afford procedural fairness to the secretary before doing so. The Shuraa Council then went on to vote to dissolve the Executive Board and Executive Committee, on the basis that they had failed to carry out their functions and duties in accordance with the objectives of the League."}, {"p_num": 27, "text": "I recognise that Mr Attia, who appears for the individual Defendants, contends that adequate notice was not given of that meeting, and it is not apparent that any formal notice was given of the resolutions that were to be put, which were of a significant nature. There is also a question as to which persons receive notice of that meeting, but the state of the evidence is such that it is not possible to reach a conclusion as to that matter. At a further meeting of the Shuraa Council, again chaired by Mr Khan, on 20 July 2024, allegations were addressed against Mr Gaffar, who was stood down from the Deputy Ameer's position. It will be no surprise, by this time, that he too was not afforded procedural fairness before that step was taken."}, {"p_num": 28, "text": "I now return to the orders which are sought by the Plaintiffs in their Amended Originating Process. It is now common ground that the orders sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 can properly be made, by way of declarations as to the validity of an annual general meeting convened on 5 March 2023 and the Shuraa Council meeting on 6 March 2023 at which persons including Mr Khan were appointed to office bearing positions within the Shuraa Council. I am satisfied that, as events have developed and given the focus of this matter by both parties in submissions, a further declaration should also be made recording my finding above that the removal of Mr Khan at the Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024 was invalid, and the meeting was inquorate from the point at which he withdrew from that meeting."}, {"p_num": 29, "text": "The Plaintiffs also seek a declaration that the Shuraa Council's decision on 18 July 2024 to dissolve the existing Executive Board and Executive Committee ofthe League was a valid exercise of the Council's powers granted by cl 17.3 of the Constitution and resulted in the dissolution of those bodies at that time. I will assume, without deciding, that that decision was within the scope of the constitutional power exercised in cl 17.3 of the League’s Constitution. I am not persuaded, in the circumstances as they stand, that I should make a declaration that it was \"valid\", which raises issues as to propriety as well as issues as to constitutional power, where there are plainly a range of issues in dispute as to the propriety of both parties' actions at the relevant time, and the manner in which these proceedings have been brought and conducted has the consequence that those issues have not been determined. For the reasons that I will note below, I am also not satisfied that it would be a proper, or at least a desirable, exercise of the Court's powers to advance the process of each faction removing the other's members from positions within the League, by an order of the Court in that regard."}, {"p_num": 30, "text": "The fourth order sought by the Plaintiffs is that the League is not bound by any decisions or actions of any members of the Executive Committee or Executive Board so dissolved after 18 July 2024. It will immediately be apparent why that order cannot be made. Plainly, it is possible or likely that the Executive Committee or the Executive Board have taken steps which will affect third parties after 18 July 2024; those steps are not identified; the third parties affected by them are not identified and they have not been given any opportunity to be heard.

Here, it seems to me, as I noted in the course of submissions, that the Court might readily be persuaded to appoint a receiver to the League, who would take the management of its affairs out of the control of both competing factions, and who could investigate whether there is any mechanism by which proper governance could be returned to the League or whether the League should be wound up on the just and equitable ground, if that were not possible.

In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any basis for an order for costs in favour of either party, because I am not satisfied that either party has had substantial success in the proceedings, when measured against the extent ofits failure.

There is a significant body of case law which addresses the position where solicitors accept instructions to represent a corporate body in proceedings, where they are not properly retained to do so. It seems to me that, in in the exercise of the Court's inherent jurisdiction to regulate its officers, namely solicitors, I should order that Mr Attia serve, and provide to my Associate, an affidavit indicating the extent of any payment that he or his firm have received from the League, and any obligations that the League may have to him or his firm to make such payment, so that the Court may take proper steps, at least in respect of Mr Attia as its officer, and potentially in respect of the League, if it emerges that assets of the League are to be applied without authority to the payment of Mr Attia's firm's costs of the proceedings.

Two of the orders sought are not controversial. A third issue arose, which I am satisfied ought to be determined, as to the effect of a purported removal of Mr Khan, the First Plaintiff, at a meeting held on 8 July 2024. Further issues are raised which have wider application, to which I will return below.The proceedings were conducted in circumstances of considerable urgency where, at the time they were commenced, I was informed that the disputes amongst the members of the League, or at least its executive bodies, had the consequence that its bank accounts had been frozen and it would not be able to meet its ordinary expenditures. The Plaintiffs have since qualified that position but Mr Attia, who appears for several of the Defendants, today indicated that the matter remained urgent, because there were difficulties arising from a mortgage payment falling due. Mr Robertson, who appears for the Plaintiffs, responds that there is no evidence of that matter, and I accept that proposition, but I nonetheless proceed on the basis that the matter is urgent and requires an urgent judgment. In those circumstances, I will give an oral judgment, and I will determine only what is necessary to determine the issues in dispute. That will have the consequence that it will neither be necessary nor appropriate to reach findings as to the multitude of factual matters which are in dispute between individual witnesses in detailed affidavits. In any event, it may not have been possible to resolve those disputes, where none of those witnesses were cross-examined to seek to test the truth of their contradictory evidence.I should note one other matter, by way of introduction. Mr Attia has purported to appear not only for the individual Defendants but also for the League. It is not apparent to me how he can have done so, in circumstances that it appears to be conceded by the Defendants that any meeting which resolved that the League should be represented was inquorate and therefore ineffective. I will, at the conclusion of this hearing, set in place orders to seek to establish whether, in fact, the League has paid fees referable to its purported representation in this matter, or is bound to do so, which would be a matter of substantial concern if there has been no proper corporate authority for it to do so.Background facts, constitutional provisions and affidavit evidenceTurning now to the matters in issue in the proceedings, I ordered Points of Claim (“POC”) and Points of Defence (“POD”) and a significant number of the matters in issue are resolved by the position taken in those documents. It is common ground (POC [1], POD [1]ff) that the League is governed by a Constitution adopted in March 2009, which is in evidence, and that the objects of the League are set out in cl 4 of that Constitution to which I have been taken. It is common ground that cl 11.3 of the Constitution makes provision for a body called the \"Shuraa Council\" which is to comprise seven financial members, who appoint persons to it to particular offices including the office of Chairman. It is common ground that the Constitution permits the appointment of alternate members who can fill a vacancy in the Shuraa Council at a meeting of the Shuraa Council. Clause 11.16 in turn sets out functions and duties of the Shuraa Council, and decisions of the Council are final and binding upon the League and its members.Importantly, it is common ground that a quorum of a meeting of the Council is formed by five members, which may include alternate members but must include the Chairman or his representative. I read the reference to \"representative\" in that clause as a person appointed by the Chairman as his representative; it is not apparent to me that it can have any other possible meaning.It is common ground that the Shuraa Council has the power to dissolve the Executive Committee and Executive Board or the League under cl 17.3 if, in the opinion of the Shuraa Council, that Executive Board and Executive Committee have failed to carry out their functions and duties in accordance with the objects enshrined in cl 4 of the Constitution.It is common ground that several members of the League were appointed to the Shuraa Council at the 2023 annual general meeting of the League, and these included Mr Khan, and that, on or about 6 March 2023, Mr Khan was appointed as Chair of the Shuraa Council. There is a dispute, which becomes important for the resolution of these proceedings, as to whether Mr Khan was subsequently removed as Chair of the Shuraa Council at a meeting on 8 July 2024.The POC and POD in turn addressed provisions in the Constitution of the League which establish a school conducted on the same premises as are occupied by the League. It is apparent, both from the POC and POD and from the evidence to which I have been taken, that there are issues as to the extent of the League's control over the school; those issues are contentious among its members; and the Commonwealth Department of Education has required the League and the school to address issues in that regard in order to retain continued funding for the school.The POC and POD in turn plead events at a meeting of the Shuraa Council on 8 July 2024, and, importantly, the Plaintiffs contend and the Defendants deny that there was no constitutional power to remove the Chair from that meeting, if in fact he was removed, or to remove him from office, if in fact that occurred. The Plaintiffs also contend that, from the moment he was removed from, or possibly left, that meeting, the Shuraa Council did not satisfy its quorum requirements, and that meeting was no longer effective. Issues also arise as to subsequent meetings that purported to be meetings of the Shuraa Council on 18 July and 20 July 2024 and the question of the validity of those meetings depends in part upon whether Mr Khan had been removed as Chair of the Shuraa Council, in which case those meetings were plainly invalid, or whetherthose meetings comprised the Shuraa Council in its proper form, by contrast with an alternate Shuraa Council which had been established under the purported chairmanship of Dr Gaffar, one of the Defendants.Each of the parties relied on numerous affidavits in the proceedings. The Plaintiffs read the affidavits dated 8 and 12 August 2024 of Mr Khan, and I note that Mr Khan's second affidavit addressed an issue as to the circumstances in which he had left the meeting that took place on 8 July 2024 and whether he had sought to appoint Mr Ud Dean as his representative at the time that he left that meeting. The Plaintiffs also read affidavits dated 12 August 2024 of Mr Jang, Mr Ali, Mr Ud Dean, Mr Afzal, Mr Manzoor. As I noted above, none of those witnesses were cross-examined, although there were significant differences between their evidence and the evidence of witnesses called by the Defendants, so there would be real difficulty in resolving factual disputes between the witnesses by the preference of the evidence of one witness for that of another, if it were not possible to determine the matters in dispute by reference largely to documentary evidence. In the event, the documentary evidence is sufficient to determine the matters in dispute in the proceedings.The Defendants in turn rely on an affidavit dated 14 August 2024 of Mr Yasin, which, consistent with other evidence led in the proceedings, frequently leads evidence by way of assertion, for example, as to a challenge as to the notice given of a purported Shuraa Council meeting on 18 July 2024. Mr Yasin also refers to a purported meeting of the Shuraa Council on 20 July 2024 where he gives more direct evidence that he did not receive an agenda or notice of that meeting. The Defendants also read the affidavit dated 14 August 2024 of Mr Illiyas, who is currently the President of the Executive Committee of the League, a separate constitutional body within the League to the Shuraa Council, and who gives evidence, inter alia, of events preceding and at the meeting on 8 July 2024. An affidavit of Dr Gaffar dated 13 August 2024 in turn addresses events at significant length, but often in an inadmissible way, by reference to Mr Gaffer's perception as to how the League should operate, irrespective of the constitutional basis on which it was established. The Defendants in turn readaffidavit evidence of Mr Khan, Mr Dean and Mr Manzoor dated 14 August 2024 in reply, but the parties paid little attention to that reply evidence in submissions.Applicable principlesI first refer to the applicable principles, before turning to the terms of the Constitution of the League, which are of some significance to the matter. First, ordinary principles of construction are applied in construing a Constitution of an incorporated body such as the League, although caution will be exercised in drawing inferences from surrounding circumstances or having regard to extraneous materials, where a constitution is a statutory contract that is a public document and may be relied on by third parties:Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd v Coopers Brewery Ltd(2006) 156 FCR 1; [2006] FCAFC 144 at [55]-[56], [124], [239]-[243];Echunga Football Club Inc v Hills Football League Inc(2014) 121 SASR 449; [2014] SASC 201 at [18]-[21];Australian Federation of Islamic Councils Inc v United Muslims of New South Wales Inc[2021] NSWCA 311 at [64];Re Baikal Sports Club Inc[2024] NSWSC 5 at [18], on which I have drawn for this summary.Second, there is a significant body of authority which recognises that, where significant matters are to be raised at a general meeting of an incorporated body, fair notice needs to be given to members of those matters. The relevant decisions include the decision of Young J inJenashare Pty Ltd v Lemrib Pty Ltd(1993) 11 ACSR 345 at 348 and the several decisions reviewed by the Supreme Court of Tasmania inEsposito v The Wilderness Society Inc[2010] TASSC 21. I recognise that those principles do not apply, at least in their full form, to meetings of directors, as I noted in my decision inKeneally (as administrator of Australian Blue Mountain International Cultural and Tourist Group Pty Ltd)[2015] NSWSC 937 at [72]. Here, the Shuraa Council does not have the character of a board of directors and seems to me to be more in the nature of an oversight body of the League. I would not, in those circumstances, read down the notice requirements so that they do not apply to the proceedings of the Shuraa Council. Third, and importantly, it is well-established that powers of suspension that are conferred by the constitution of an incorporated body areto be construed narrowly and strictly in accordance with the terms of that body's constitution:Kabbara v Australian National Sports Club Inc[2020] NSWSC 497 at [39].Turning now to the terms of the League's Constitution, it is plain enough that, as Mr Robertson who appears for the Plaintiffs points out, that Constitution adopts a form that is unusual by the standards of incorporated bodies generally, reflecting a recognition of the role of the League within its community. The preamble refers to the relevance of Quran, and cl 4, to which I referred above, identifies a wide range of specific objects of the League, within the broader context of the promotion of the understanding of Islam among its members, the general Muslim community and Australian society. Those objects include religious objects and an educational object, which is relevant to the League's involvement with the school. Clauses 11 and following refer to the operation of the Shuraa Council, which is to be comprised of seven financial members of the League, including a Chairman (also known as the \"Ameer\") who has a long term of appointment, of some nine years, a Deputy Chair who has a seven-year term of appointment, and other persons holding offices and other members. Clause 11.21 provides for the manner in which decisions of the Shuraa Council shall be made and cl 11.22 provides that such a decision is final and binding on the League and its members.As I noted above, cl 11.23 provides that any five members of the Shuraa Council which must include the Chairman (Ameer) or his representative shall constitute a quorum for a properly convened meeting of the Shuraa Council, and cl 11.24 provides that, if a quorum is not present, the meeting stands adjourned until such time as a quorum is present. Clause 11.35 provides that the Shuraa Council has power to discipline its members who in the opinion of the majority of the members are not fit to continue as a member of the Council or have acted in a manner that has brought disrepute to the Council or the League or have acted against the objects of the League and cl 11.37 provides that, as and when required, the Shuraa Council may determine that the Chairman shall stand aside in cases where he is \"deemed to have conflict of interest\".Two things should be noted about those clauses. The first is that they each require an opinion to have been formed, namely that the relevant member has conducted himself in a particular way and, in the case of the Chairman, that he is deemed to have \"conflict of interest\". Second, as a matter of the ordinary incidents of Australian law, the formation of that opinion, in a manner that is prejudicial to the person to whom the opinion is directed, will be subject to requirements of procedural fairness. Third, obviously enough, the exercise of those powers requires that the relevant opinion in fact has been formed after complying with those obligations of procedural fairness.Clause 17.3 of the Constitution in turn provides that the Shuraa Council of the League has power to dissolve the Executive Board and Executive Committee if, in the opinion of the Shuraa Council, the Executive Board and Executive Committee have failed to carry out the function and duties of the League in accordance with its objects as enshrined in its Constitution. Again, that clause requires that a particular opinion has been formed, and an obligation of procedural fairness would attach to the process by which that opinion was formed. Appendix 4 in turn refers to the principles of consultation reflected in the concept of \"Sunnats of Mashwarah\", which govern the operations of the Shuraa Council and relevantly require that the Ameer present the meeting agenda that has to be discussed and request the opinions of others present.The purported removal of Mr Khan as Chair of the Shuraa CouncilTurning now to the relevant documentary evidence, it is apparent that, at least from 24 March 2023, the League has been in discussion with the Commonwealth Department of Education in respect of concerns as to its influence over the operation of the school, and steps that were required to be taken to address that matter, as a condition of continuing Commonwealth funding of the school. Those issues appear to have given rise to dispute amongst members of the League and, in particular, among members of the Executive Committee on the one hand and the Shuraa Council on the other.Correspondence took place, in the period immediately prior to a Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024, as to the basis on which members of the Executive Committee and Executive Board would join a Shuraa Council meeting on that date and it appears to have been agreed that they could do so in order to present as to the position in respect of a suggested constitution, or at least issues as to consultation in respect of that constitution, which was intended to address the Commonwealth Department of Education's concerns as to the control of the school.A significant contest then arises as to events at the meeting on 8 July 2024 which are recorded in minutes found in the evidence (Ex D1,117ff). At about 8pm on that date, some 17 members of the Executive Committee and Executive Board members joined the meeting, and there was then discussion initiated by Mr Khan as Chair, of issues as to the Constitution and, from about 8.25pm, the President of the League, Mr Illiyas, in turn addressed the meeting. Mr Illiyas then raised concerns as to the process and procedure of a previous investigation committee and as to \"another matter\", and insisted that those \"conflicted\" in respect of the investigation committee must leave the room. It must immediately be noted that this was an unusual, and it seems to me unsustainable, concept of a \"conflict\". The reference to those who were \"conflicted\" was, it seems, to those against whom allegations were to be made by Mr Illiyas. It is not apparent to me how, consistent with Australian law, a person would be“conflicted”and excluded from a meeting because an allegation is made against him or against her, which he or she may otherwise take the opportunity to answer. To the contrary, that person has not a disability, namely a conflict, but instead a right to be afforded procedural fairness in respect of the allegations that are made against him or her. The President then expanded upon his concerns, and it appears that Mr Khan and two other persons were persuaded to leave the room on the basis that they were \"conflicted\" because allegations were being advanced against them. The meeting then continued in Mr Khan's absence.It is put by the Plaintiffs, and denied by the Defendants, that at this point Mr Khan had appointed another person to act as his representative as Chair, afterhe left the room. That would be consistent with the constitutional provisions to which I have referred above. However, the Defendants’position, and plainly the basis on which the meeting was conducted, was that instead Dr Gaffar would become the Chair of that meeting, apparently because there was some expectation that the Deputy Chair would do so which finds no basis in the League’s Constitution of the League.That was the manner in which the meeting continued and, at that point, a significant number of further allegations were made against Mr Khan and others, to which Mr Attia, who appears for the Defendants, gives significant weight in submissions. Discussions continued and, at the conclusion of the meeting, resolutions passed were that Mr Khan and Mr Jang be stood down from the Shuraa Council indefinitely based on a number of serious allegations raised against them in matters relating to the Council and their involvement in the investigation committee; that the allegations against those two persons would be objectively investigated by the Shuraa Council, and a final determination would be made based on those findings; and that Dr Gaffar was now the Chair of the Shuraa Council, assuming this position from his previous position as Deputy Chair by virtue of the provisions of the League's Constitution.Several things should be said about these resolutions. The first is that it is not apparent that the resolution that Messrs Khan and Jang be stood down from the Shuraa Council is sustainable on any basis. First, if the Defendants are correct that Mr Khan had not in fact appointed a representative to act as Chair in his absence, then the quorum for the Shuraa Council was not satisfied for the whole of the discussion that took place after Mr Khan's withdrawal from the meeting, because that quorum required the presence of Mr Khan, who had not resigned as Chair and had not then been removed as Chair. Second, the process which was adopted was wholly inconsistent with both notice requirements and procedural fairness requirements to which I have referred above. There was no notice that such a proposal would be raised at the meeting to allow persons attending fair notice of the matters that they were to be asked to address. Second, no procedural fairness was afforded to Mr Khan in respect of the allegations; to the contrary, he was invited to remove himselffrom the meeting, preventing him from having any opportunity to answer the allegations.Third, the resolutions have the remarkable feature that the decision to stand down Mr Khan from the Shuraa Council comes first and the investigation of whether there is a basis for it would come second. That is not consistent with the terms of the Constitution which, so far as it includes disciplinary provisions extending to Mr Khan as Chair, provides that the Shuraa Council may determine that he stand aside where he is deemed to have \"conflict of interest\". The Shuraa Council here does not reach that decision, because it is apparent that the resolution it had passed contemplates a further investigation, before any decision as to the rights or wrongs of the allegations against Mr Khan is made. Second, if, contrary to that view, the Shuraa Council had made that decision, it was made without affording procedural fairness to Mr Khan. Further, for the reasons noted above, at least on the basis of the Defendants’position, and the manner on which that meeting was conducted, it was made while the meeting was inquorate, because Mr Khan was absent from it. Further, so far as the resolution contemplates that Dr Gaffar would become the Chair of the Shuraa Council, by virtue of the provisions of the League’s Constitution of the League, no such provision has been identified and it is not apparent that any such provision exists.For these reasons, I am comfortably satisfied that the resolutions recorded at the conclusion of the minutes of the Shuraa Council meeting were void and that Mr Khan remains the Chair of the Shuraa Council.Further meetings of the Shuraa CouncilIssues also arise in respect of subsequent meetings of the Shuraa Council on 18 July and 20 July 2024, by which time the parties had fallen into dispute. At the meeting on 18 July 2024, a Shuraa Council of which Mr Khan acted as Chair referred to what was described as a \"mutiny\" by the President and Shuraa members, presumably not extending to all members of the Shuraa Council. The Shuraa Council then unanimously resolved to stand down its secretary dueto an investigation regarding certain matters, but, consistent with the process adopted by its opponents, also did not afford procedural fairness to the secretary before doing so. The Shuraa Council then went on to vote to dissolve the Executive Board and Executive Committee, on the basis that they had failed to carry out their functions and duties in accordance with the objectives of the League.I recognise that Mr Attia, who appears for the individual Defendants, contends that adequate notice was not given of that meeting, and it is not apparent that any formal notice was given of the resolutions that were to be put, which were of a significant nature. There is also a question as to which persons receive notice of that meeting, but the state of the evidence is such that it is not possible to reach a conclusion as to that matter. At a further meeting of the Shuraa Council, again chaired by Mr Khan, on 20 July 2024, allegations were addressed against Mr Gaffar, who was stood down from the Deputy Ameer's position. It will be no surprise, by this time, that he too was not afforded procedural fairness before that step was taken.The orderssoughtI now return to the orders which are sought by the Plaintiffs in their Amended Originating Process. It is now common ground that the orders sought in paragraphs 1 and 2 can properly be made, by way of declarations as to the validity of an annual general meeting convened on 5 March 2023 and the Shuraa Council meeting on 6 March 2023 at which persons including Mr Khan were appointed to office bearing positions within the Shuraa Council. I am satisfied that, as events have developed and given the focus of this matter by both parties in submissions, a further declaration should also be made recording my finding above that the removal of Mr Khan at the Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024 was invalid, and the meeting was inquorate from the point at which he withdrew from that meeting.The Plaintiffs also seek a declaration that the Shuraa Council's decision on 18 July 2024 to dissolve the existing Executive Board and Executive Committee ofthe League was a valid exercise of the Council's powers granted by cl 17.3 of the Constitution and resulted in the dissolution of those bodies at that time. I will assume, without deciding, that that decision was within the scope of the constitutional power exercised in cl 17.3 of the League’s Constitution. I am not persuaded, in the circumstances as they stand, that I should make a declaration that it was \"valid\", which raises issues as to propriety as well as issues as to constitutional power, where there are plainly a range of issues in dispute as to the propriety of both parties' actions at the relevant time, and the manner in which these proceedings have been brought and conducted has the consequence that those issues have not been determined. For the reasons that I will note below, I am also not satisfied that it would be a proper, or at least a desirable, exercise of the Court's powers to advance the process of each faction removing the other's members from positions within the League, by an order of the Court in that regard.The fourth order sought by the Plaintiffs is that the League is not bound by any decisions or actions of any members of the Executive Committee or Executive Board so dissolved after 18 July 2024. It will immediately be apparent why that order cannot be made. Plainly, it is possible or likely that the Executive Committee or the Executive Board have taken steps which will affect third parties after 18 July 2024; those steps are not identified; the third parties affected by them are not identified and they have not been given any opportunity to be heard. The Court would not make an order that would, even on its face, prevent those third parties asserting that they were entitled to rely upon steps taken by persons who had been held out by the League as being members of the Executive Committee or Executive Board during the relevant period.The Plaintiffs seek similar declarations in respect of the Shuraa Council's decision on 20 July 2024 to form an interim Executive Board, and as to the membership of that board, but that also raises a wider question of propriety, beyond the question of constitutional validity, and a question why the Court should make such an order where to do so would likely advance the divisions between the relevant parties.Next, the Plaintiffs seek a mandatory order that the affairs of the League be managed by the interim Executive Board until the next annual general meeting of the board. I would not make that order, as a matter of discretion, even if I have made the prior orders on which it is based. I would not do so, because the Court could not be satisfied that, as matters stand, either faction can be left to manage the affairs of the League in the interests of all its members including members of the other faction. Here, it seems to me, as I noted in the course of submissions, that the Court might readily be persuaded to appoint a receiver to the League, who would take the management of its affairs out of the control of both competing factions, and who could investigate whether there is any mechanism by which proper governance could be returned to the League or whether the League should be wound up on the just and equitable ground, if that were not possible. However, neither party seeks that relief, and I made clear that I would not order that relief where neither party sought it.The consequence will be that the matters will be returned to events as they stood prior to 8 July 2024, so far as Mr Khan will be entitled to resume the Chairmanship of the Shuraa Council and the parties will presumably remain at loggerheads, unless and until either one of them brings an application to the Court to appoint a receiver who might address the position in which the League now finds itself. That is plainly not a desirable result, but it seems to me to be preferable to exercising the Court's powers so as to advance the interests of one faction over another, where each seeks to exclude the members of the other from the management of the League.CostsPlainly, the Plaintiffs have had some limited success, so far as they will have obtained relief that is uncontentious as to the meetings on 5 March 2023 and 6 March 2023, and relief that was not sought, at least in terms, as to the invalidity of the removal of Mr Khan as Chairman of the Shuraa Council. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any basis for an order for costs in favour of either party, because I am not satisfied that either party has had substantial success in the proceedings, when measured against the extent ofits failure. I will, however, hear the parties as to costs, if they seek to be heard, by allowing an opportunity for written submissions.The League’s role in the proceedingsIt remains to note, as I noted at the commencement of this judgment, that Mr Attia or his firm initially purported to represent the League in these proceedings, relying ona meeting which they accept was inquorate which passed a resolution indicating its support for their doing so. It is not apparent to me that that action had any constitutional validity, so as to bind the League or provide a proper basis for the League to paythecosts of Mr Attia or his firm in respect of the proceedings. There is a significant body of case law which addresses the position where solicitors accept instructions to represent a corporate body in proceedings, where they are not properly retained to do so. It seems to me that, in in the exercise of the Court's inherent jurisdiction to regulate its officers, namely solicitors, I should order that Mr Attia serve, and provide to my Associate, an affidavit indicating the extent of any payment that he or his firm have received from the League, and any obligations that the League may have to him or his firm to make such payment, so that the Court may take proper steps, at least in respect of Mr Attia as its officer, and potentially in respect of the League, if it emerges that assets of the League are to be applied without authority to the payment of Mr Attia's firm's costs of the proceedings. I will hear Mr Attia as to the timing of that process and I will relist the matter for that issue to be addressed.I direct that:1.The parties submit agreed orders to give effect to this judgment, and as to costs, by 4pm on Monday, 19 August 2024, and, if there is disagreement between the parties as to the orders to be made, their respective draft orders and submissions as to the differences between them. I have allowed a relatively limited period for the preparation of those orders, given the urgency of the matter.2.Mr Attia, for himself and his firm, serve and send to the Associate to Black J, by noon on 19 August 2024, an affidavit setting out the amount of any payments which have been received by his firm from the First Defendant, The Muslim League of NSW Inc, in respect of these proceedings, and whether any further payments are to be made by the League to his firm, or would be accepted by his firm if made by the League, in respect of the appearance of the League in these proceedings.Judgmentas to PAYMENT OF SOLICITOR’S COSTS BY THE LEAGUE – ex tempore (Revised 20 August 2024)As I noted above, an issue aroseat the hearing as to whether the League could properlypaythe costs and disbursements ofMr Attiaand hisfirm,Attia Lawyers and Consultants, in respect of any purported engagement by the Leagueof that firmto represent it in these proceedings. Mr Attia has rightly recognised, in the course of submissions today, first, that his costs agreement is with the Second to Ninth Defendants, the individual Defendants, and not with the Leagueand, second, that hecould not act for the League and does not act for the League, because it is the subject of these proceedings and does not have an interest in a contest as to its control between two competing groups of its members.Mr Attia, in response to an invitation from the Court to confirm his position by affidavit, indicated that he had not received any money to date from the League. He also indicated that he did not expect to receive any money from the League in relation to the current proceedings. That latter confirmation fell somewhat short, because it did not address what Mr Attia would have done if, contrary to his identified expectation, he did receive money from the League, notwithstanding it did not have authority to make a payment to him without a relevant approval.In the event, Mr Attia hasnowfairly clarified that matter by offering an undertaking to the Court, for himself and his firm, that if he were to receive payment from the League, he would not accept that payment and would reimburse it to the League. That seems to me to be sufficient, and the Plaintiffs have accepted that it is sufficient, to address any concern that MrAttia wouldbe wrongly paid by the League in respect of his role for individual Defendants in the proceedings.I therefore note the undertaking of MrAttia, for himself and his firm, that if he were to receive payment from the League in respect of any aspect of these proceedings, he would not accept that payment and would reimburse it to the League.FURTHER JUDGMENT AS TO orders and costsThe parties’ submissions as to ordersThe Plaintiffs submitted proposed orders which gave effect to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the relief claimed in the Amended Originating Process, which were common ground,andalsosought a declaration that no resolution was validly passed by the Shuraa Council on 8 July 2024. That declaration extended beyond any relief they had soughtand beyondthe finding that I had reached in mysubstantivejudgment, namely that the removal of Mr Khan at the Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024 was invalid and thatmeeting was inquorate from the point at which he withdrew from the meeting.I will make adeclaration limited to that effect.After I allowed to the parties an opportunity for further consultation as to the form of orders, which apparently did not occur, Mr Attia sent a further communication to the Courtattaching correspondence between the parties, which it is neither necessary nor appropriate that I address and submitted draft orders which included two additional orders. The first additional order sought by the Defendants identified the persons who held a position on the Executive Board and Executive Committee as at 8 July 2024 and sought an order that they had not been removed from their elected positions. The Defendants did not seek relief of that character at the hearing and I reached no such finding,whereI did not determine the validity or invalidity of the Shuraa Council’s steps taken after 8 July 2024 to remove the Executive Board and Executive Committee. The second additional order sought by the Defendants was that, from 8 July 2024, the League was not bound by decisions purportedly made inthe name of either the Shuraa CouncilortheExecutive Committee or Executive Board, other than with notice to all the members of the Shuraa Counciland themembers of the Executive Board and Executive Committeethat the Defendants contend are still in office. I will not make such an order. First, it was not sought at the hearing; second, I did not reach any determination which would have that result;and,third, the League may well be bound by such decisions, so far as they affect the interests of third parties, irrespective of the validity or invalidity ofthe purportedremoval of thosepersonsfrom office by the Shuraa Council.Principles and the parties’ submissions as to costsThe Plaintiffs sought an order that the SecondandNinth Defendants pay their costs of the proceedings.The relevant principles are well established,although the parties did not address them, and I have drawn onthem inmy judgment inRe Heartland Group Pty Ltd[2024] NSWSC 1029 at [4]ff for the summary that appears below. The Court has power to make an order for costs under s98(1) of theCivil Procedure Act2005 (NSW) (“CPA”) and r 42.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)(“UCPR”). Section 98 of theCPAconfers a discretionary power to determine costs on the Court and requires that that discretion be exercised judicially:Ballam v Ferro (No 2)[2022] NSWSC 1358 at [54]. Rule 42.1 of theUCPRin turn provides that:“Subject to this Part, if the court makes any order as to costs, the court is to order that the costs follow the event unless it appears to the court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.”A successful party in proceedings has a“reasonable expectation”of being awarded costs against an unsuccessful party, unless there is good reason for that presumption to be displaced:Oshlack v Richmond River Council(1998) 193 CLR 72; [1998] HCA 11 at [22], [134]. InCommonwealth of Australia v Gretton[2008] NSWCA 117 at [121], Hodgson JA (with whom Mason P agreed) observed that:“… underlying both the general rule that costs follow the event, and the qualifications to that rule, is the idea that costs should be paid in a way that is fair, having regard to what the court considers to be the responsibility of each party for the incurring of the costs.”That observation was cited, with apparent approval, by the Court of Appeal inHeath v Greenacre Business Park Pty Ltd[2016] NSWCA 34 at [98] and, inCellarit Pty Ltd v Cawarrah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2)[2018] NSWCA 266 at [7]-[14], McColl JA summarised the applicable principles as follows:“Section 98 of the[CPA]confers a wide discretion on the court with respect to costs. The general rule is that court costs follow the event unless the court makes some other order pursuant to the discretion conferred by [UCPR]r 42.1.As Beazley JA explained inBaker v Towle[(2008) 39 Fam LR 323; [2008] NSWCA 73 at [11] (Mathews AJA agreeing)], in most litigation, UCPR r 42.1 “operates in a straightforward way, ‘the event’ being readily identifiable as a judgment for the plaintiff or the defendant on the claim. In that sense, ‘the event’ to which the rule refers is the result of the proceedings, so that the party who succeeds on the claim before the court is awarded costs, unless the court, pursuant to the discretion conferred by r 42.1, makes ‘some other order’”.Underlying both the general rule that costs follow the event, and qualifications to that rule, is the idea that costs should be paid in a way that is fair, having regard to what the court considers to be the responsibility of each party for the incurring of the costs.”The case law also recognises that“[t]he disposition which is ultimately to be made in any case where there are competing considerations will reflect a broad evaluative judgment of what justice requires”:Gray v Richards [No 2](2014) 252 CLR 601;[2014] HCA 47 at [2].InBostik Australia Pty Ltd v Liddiard (No 2)[2009] NSWCA 304 at [38], the Court of Appeal noted that, where there are multiple issues in a case, the Court generally does not attempt to differentiate between the issues on which a party was successful and those on which it failed. However, the Court also there pointed to several circumstances in which a different approach might be justified, and noted that:“Whether an order contrary to the general rule of costs follow the event should be made depends on the circumstances of the case viewed against the wide discretionary powers of the Court, which powers should be liberally construed.”InMobis Parts Australia Pty Ltd v XL Insurance Company SE (No 2)[2019] NSWCA 19 at [5], the Court of Appeal noted that:“There is no issue as to the relevant principles. The discretion under[CPA], s 98 is ordinarily exercised by requiring that costs follow the event:[UCPR], r 42.1. This default position was historically understood to mean (so as to preserve the practice, where any issue was tried with a jury, that those costs followed the outcome of that event) that the costs of the several issues went to the party who succeeded on them respectively, while the general costs went to him who on the whole succeeded on the action … But more recent authority favours the award of the costs of proceedings to the party successful overall without any differentiation as to issues, at least unless a particular issue or group of issues is clearly dominant or separable … And the costs arising from such issues have more readily been apportioned where the party successful overall is the plaintiff …” [citations omitted]Where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings, any question of apportionment is recognised as being very much a matter of discretion, the exercise of which“will often depend upon matters of impression and evaluation”:Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd(1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272;[1993] FCA 259.In support of their claim for costs, the Plaintiffsrefer to the conclusions I had reached in mysubstantivejudgment, which theycontend“restored the Shuraa Council to its original form prior to the factional division caused by the actions of the Second and Ninth Defendant[sic]”. They submit that:“Accordingly, the Second and Ninth Defendant [sic] were the immediate cause of the current proceedings. The Plaintiffs were successful in the proceedings by restoring the ShuraaCouncil and had to incur costs in doing so.”The Plaintiffs then submit that the Second and Ninth Defendants should pay the costs of the proceedings.While it is not apparent why the Plaintiffs now contend that, of the several Defendants to the proceedings,only the Second and Ninth of them should pay the costs of the proceedings, I proceed on the basis that that is the order they seek.The individual Defendants, by their solicitor Mr Attia,indicate that theyseekno order forcosts in their favour. Mr Attia, in submissions, pointed to the circumstancesof urgencyin which the proceedings had been commenced,wherebank accounts of the League had been frozen. Mr Attia sought to make additional submissions as to the merit of the matters which were determined by the judgment, which I disregard. He submits that each party has had a measureof success with respect to the relief claimed in the Plaintiffs’application. Healsosubmits that:“The outcomes of this Court can be presented to the Members as definitive proof that whilst the ousting of the Chairman on 8 July 2024 was invalid, the faction that attempted to expel [Sh]uraa [C]ouncil members, dissolved the Executive Committee and freeze the [League’s] bank accounts were in the wrong.”I should point out thatIreachedno such determinationin my judgment. I found that the removal of Mr Khan as Chair of the Shuraa Council was invalid; I did not determine the validity of subsequent steps in respect of the dissolution of theExecutiveCommittee; and Irecognisedthat theappropriatereliefmay well bethe appointment of receivers to the League for specified purposes, whichthe parties did notseek. Mr Attia also speculates as to the possible outcome ofan application forreliefthatthe Defendants did notmake andI also need not address. I need not addressthesesubmissions further, where the Defendants accept that it is appropriate that there be no order as to costs.It seems to me that the Plaintiffs’submissions do not provide any basis for the order that they seek as to costs. As I noted above, they obtained two orders which were not controversial and were not contested and a third order which they did not seek, as to the invalidity of the removal of Mr Khan as Chairman of the Shuraa Council, once that matter emerged as a significant issue in dispute in the hearing. They did not obtain the balance of the orders they sought. It does not seem to me that this can fairly be characterised as an event in favour of the Plaintiffs so as to support a conclusion that costs should follow the event in their favour, or that it has the result that an order for costs in their favour would be a just result. I also do not accept the Plaintiffs’submission that the Second and Ninth Defendants, or indeed the Second to Ninth Defendants, were the”immediate cause”of the current proceeding, which arose from the wider breakdown of corporate governance in the League and the development of factions within its membership, each of which sought to take steps adverse to the other. I will make no order as to the costs of the proceedings.Orders and costsI have previously notedthe undertaking of Mr Attia, for himself and his firm, that if he were to receive payment from the League in respect of any aspect of these proceedings, he would not accept that payment and would reimburse it to the League.Inowmake the followingadditionalorders:1By consent, declare that the Annual General Meeting convened on 5 March 2023 was a validly convened meeting of The Muslim League of NSW Inc ABN 66 613 774 252 (League) and that the following persons were validly elected to the Shuraa Council of the League at that time:a.Nizam Ud Deanb.Sheikh Jangc.Mohammed Afzald.Nazeel Khane.Dr Abdul Gaffarf.Mahamad Ajewal Alig.Mohammed Yasin2By consent, declare that, at the Shuraa Council meeting on 6 March 2023, the following persons were validly appointed to the following office-bearing positions:a.Nazeel Khan - Chairmanb.Dr Abdul Gaffar - Deputy Chairmanc.Mohammed Yasin – Secretary3.Declare that the removal of Mr Khan at the Shuraa Council meeting on 8 July 2024 was invalid and that meeting was inquorate from the point at which he withdrew from that meeting.4.There be no order as to the costs of the proceedings.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Theproperty addresseswere70 Craigie Avenue, Kanwal (‘the Seaforthproperty’)and 68 Craigie Avenue, Kanwal (‘thepetrolstationsite’).The Seaforthproperty andthePetrol Station Sitewereimmediately adjacent neighbouring properties.The Seaforthpropertywaslocated down a gradient from thepetrolstationsite.In August 2017, Seaforth notified Zoya that petroleum hydrocarbon contamination had been identified in the groundwater of Seaforth’sProperty and thatthepetrol station sitewas the likely source.Over the following years,Seaforth’s solicitors made numerous attempts to engage with Zoya’s representationin an effort tomanage or minimise the contamination, with little to no success.On 11 December 2018,the EPA declared all of thepetrol station siteandpart of the Seaforthproperty as significantlycontaminatedOn 21 February2020,the EPA issued Zoya with a management order pursuant to s14 of theContaminated Land Management Act1997(NSW)(‘CLMAct’).On 16 September 2021,the EPA charged Zoya with a failure to carry out the requirements of the management order and commenced proceedings in the Land and EnvironmentCourt of NSW.On 16 December2022,Zoya was convicted of a breach of s14(6)(a) of theCLMand fined$320,000On 11 April 2024,the original directors of Zoya, Satwinder Singh and Rizwan Rana, resigned as directorsand Sania Sania was appointed as the sole director and secretary in their place. Sania Sania became the sole shareholder of Zoya at the same time.On 18 April 2024, Zoyaresolved thatit should be wound up and placed into voluntary administration.On 2 July 2024, the Supreme Court made orders pursuant to s500(2) of theCorporations Act 2001(Cth) granting leave to Seaforth to continue this proceeding against Zoya.On 9 July 2024,Seaforth’s solicitor advised the liquidator that the Supreme Courthadset the date for the hearing of Seaforth’s damages claim against Zoya for 29 July 2024 (CB 195).On 17 July 2024,the liquidator advised Seaforth’s solicitor that he did not intend to appear at the scheduled hearing on 29 July 2024 (CB 197).I acknowledge that I have largelyand gratefullyreproduced the submissions made by the plaintiff’s senior counsel and adopted them. I have added some additional findings and submissions of my ownto those submissions.EvidenceThe plaintiff relies on theaffidavitsof Stephen John Rush(Seaforth’ssolicitor)dated16 May 2023,Bruce Stanley Johnson(Director of Seaforth)dated 16 May 2023,Andrew Kita(‘Kita’)of Trace Environmental dated 24 May 2024andDean Galanos(‘Mr Galanos’)of Property Logic dated 24 May 2024.On Seaforth’s land exists an uninhabitable house and a shed.The shed is used for storage.In October 2016, Seaforth was alerted to the presence of contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil and groundwater of the Seaforthproperty. It had reached an in-principle agreement with Australian Unity Funds ManagementLtd (‘Australian Unity’)to sell the Seaforthproperty to Australian Unity for a price of $10 million.Australian Unity intended to develop the site into a hospital and aged care facility. The offer was subject to due diligence investigations. Australian Unity engaged KPMG SGA Property Consultancy (‘KPMG’) to perform a targeted environmental investigation. KPMG produced an expert report, provided to Seaforth, which identified the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons and that the likely source of the petroleum hydrocarbons was the service station at thepetrol station site.It noted:“[T]hesourceof the petroleum hydrocarbonsis likely to be the adjacent service station to the northeast of”the Seaforthproperty.”Consequently, in late 2016, Seaforth engaged itssolicitors to advise it in relation to the contamination and its rights and responsibilities under theCLM Act.Between April 2017 and May 2018, Seaforth engaged environmental consultants, Cardno Geotech Solutions(‘Cardno’),to provide advice in respect of the contamination of theSeaforthproperty and its likely sources. On 27 June2017, Cardno produced a report concluding that the sources of the contamination were continuing to discharge hydrocarbons, and that it appeared that theunderground storage tank systems(‘USTs’)on thepetrol station sitewere currently losing hydrocarbon product which was then entering the subsurface of the Seaforthproperty.The Cardno report concluded that:“It appears thathydrocarbon product is currently leaving the boundary of theService Station Site and entering the subsurface of the”Seaforth property.”On 7 August 2017,Seaforth’s solicitors wrote to Zoya to inform it of the contamination of theSeaforthproperty and that an expert had identified that the likely source of the hydrocarbons was the adjacent service station and may be ongoing. The letter demanded that Zoya immediately prevent the contamination.Seaforth’ssolicitors did not receive a response. It wrote to Zoya again on 28 August 2017. On 14 September 2017,Seaforth’ssolicitors received a letter from Zoya’s legal representatives, who did not admit that Zoya had caused any contamination. On 25 September 2017,Seaforth’s solicitors responded to that letter and provided documents including the Cardno report of 27 June 2017. Between 30 November 2017 and 7 October 2020,Seaforth’ssolicitors sent Zoya a further nine letters about the contamination. The only responses from Zoya were through its lawyers in July 2020: first, to request copies of all previous correspondence (on 9 July 2020) and then to state that Zoya did not accept any liability for contamination of the Seaforthproperty and to assert that there was no conclusive evidence that the contamination of the Seaforthproperty emanated from thepetrol station site(on 28 July 2020).TheEnvironmentProtection Authority’sinvolvement with SeaforthandZoyaOn 7 August 2017, Seaforth notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority (‘EPA’) of the contamination, as it was obliged to do under s 60(2) of the CLM Act.On 11 December 2018, the EPA declaredall ofthepetrol station siteand part of the Seaforthproperty (‘thecontaminatedsite’)as significantly contaminated land, pursuant to s 11 of the CLM Act. The declaration stated that:the EPA had found that thecontaminatedsitewas contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons;the EPA had determined that the contamination was significant enough to warrant regulation under the CLM Act;the groundwater was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons at concentrations exceeding guidelines that are protective of human health and/or the environment;the source of contamination at thepetrol station sitehad not been suitably identified and appeared to be ongoing; andthe extent of groundwater contamination had not been delineated.A declaration under s 11 enlivens the EPA’s regulatory powers underdivision 2 ofpart 3 of the CLM Act. Division 2 sets out two avenues for addressing contamination, one coercive and the other voluntary. The first is that the EPA may make a management order in respect of significantly contaminated land under s 14, directing an appropriate person or public authority to carry out specified action or submit for the EPA’s approval a plan of management of the land. Such action may include investigating the existence, nature and extent of any significant contamination or harm caused by the contamination, investigating the most appropriate means for undertaking remediation of the land, and carrying out remediation: CLM Act, s 16. It is an offence, punishable with considerable pecuniary penalties, to fail to comply with any direction or other requirement specified by a management order: s 14(6).The alternative avenue is that a person may furnish the EPA with a proposal for the management of significantly contaminated land (a voluntary management proposal), pursuant to s 17 of the CLM Act. The EPA may then approve a proposal unconditionally or subject toconditions ifit is satisfied of certain matters.Once the EPA made a declaration under s11, it was inevitable that Seaforth would have to take steps to investigate and remediate the contamination on the Seaforthproperty pursuant to a voluntary management proposal of its owndevising orbe subject to a compulsory managementorder.In December 2018, Seaforth engaged Harwood Environmental Consultants,(‘Harwood’),to advise it in relation to the contamination and remediation of the Seaforthproperty, and to develop a voluntary management proposal. Throughout 2019, Seaforth submitted several draft voluntary management proposals, developed by Harwood, to the EPA and received feedback on those drafts.On 6 December 2019, the EPA issued Seaforth anotice ofapproval ofvoluntarymanagementproposal. The approved voluntary management proposal required Seaforth to achieve the following outcomes:definetheextent of impact to soil gas, soil and groundwater to augment the current dataset;define the risk to human health and the environment andto recommendany remediation/management or pilot studies to ensure protection of human health and the environment for the current and approved use of the Seaforthproperty; andremediate the Seaforthproperty, if required, so there are no unacceptable risks to human health and the environment.The voluntary management proposal also required Seaforth to engage a qualified site consultant to carry out investigations and prepare relevant plans and reports, and a site auditor to prepare certain reports and ensure compliance with the voluntary management proposal. The voluntary management proposal was subsequently amended on four occasions. Seaforth engagedHarwoodas its consultant until July 2021, Trace EnvironmentalConsultants (‘Trace’) as its consultant from July 2021, and David Gregory of Geo-Logix Pty Ltd (‘Geo-Logix’) as its site auditor. Harwood, Trace and Geo-Logix have each performed extensivework as required by the voluntary management proposal.In May 2023, after extensive testing, investigating and reporting to the site auditor and theEPA, Trace prepared a remedial action plan. On or about 7 June 2023, Trace obtained approval for theremedial action planfrom the site auditor. On or about 9 June 2023, Trace submitted theremedial action planto the EPA. Remediation of thecontaminatedsite began that month and continued through to August 2023.On 31 August 2023, Geo-Logix issued asiteauditstatement, certifying that the voluntarymanagement proposal had been complied with.Foritspart, Zoya submitted a draft voluntary management proposal to the EPA on 31 December 2018. After receiving comments from the EPA, it submitted an updated version on 28 February 2019. However, on 15 April 2019, the EPA advised that the proposal could notbeapproved, because Seaforth had not been given the opportunity to participate in the formulation of the proposal submitted for its property, as required under s17(4)(c)of the CLM,and because of other inadequacies. Zoya did not submit any further draft voluntary management proposals.On 21 February 2020, the EPA issued a management order to Zoya, pursuant to s14of the CLM Act. Among other things, the management order provided that:the EPA believed that thecontaminatedsitewas“significantly contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons as a result of the use of[thepetrol station site]as a service station and the migration of the petroleum hydrocarbons onto part of[the Seaforthproperty]”;investigations to date had been limited but indicated the potential for multiple contamination sources and potentially multiple releases over time;Zoya was responsible for significant contamination of thecontaminatedsite, pursuant to s 13(2)(a) of the CLMAct;there appeared to be an ongoing source of petroleum contamination originating from the central forecourt area of the service station that had not been suitably identified orrectified;surface water management at thecontaminatedsitewas poor with unsealed section of the forecourt that were heavily fuel stained; andthere was no collection or treatment of contaminated surface water run-off from the forecourt area.The management order required Zoya to take actions, including to engage a consultant to carry out the work involved in investigating and remediating the land, to engage an accredited site auditor to determine compliance with the management order, to engage a duly qualified person to carry out equipment integrity checks of theunderground petroleum storage systemsand all associated fuel infrastructure on the land at thepetrol station siteand to identify any faulty infrastructure ortheabsence of spill protection/containment measures that may be contributing to contamination, and, where that duly qualified person identified operational issues, to take immediate action to rectify the problem (this last step was termed Direction D(ii)).On 23 April 2020TheEPA issued an amended management order to Zoya.On 24 July 2020, Zoya provided an‘equipmentintegritytest’report for theunderground petroleum storage systemsand associated infrastructure, preparedby a consultant, to the EPA in accordance with Direction D(i) of the management order. The report outlined the following:three of the fourunderground storage tank systemsfailed the MESA 2D acoustical test and required further investigation and possible rectification; andthe unleaded petrol (‘ULP’) fuel suction line from the ULP 1 tank to bowsers failed the line test due to a pin hole leak in its anaconda and required immediate action and rectification.Zoya failed to carry out the rectification works required bydirection D(ii) immediately, as required. On 16 September 2021, the EPA charged Zoya with failure to carry out the requirements ofdirection D(ii) and commenced a prosecution of Zoya in the Land and Environment Court of NSW. Zoya ultimately pleaded guilty to the offence. For the purposes of sentencing, Zoya and the EPA agreed to astatement ofagreedfacts, reproduced in full in the ultimate judgment in the proceeding. (Admissionsmade by Zoya in thestatement ofagreedfacts are admissible in this proceeding pursuant to s 81 of theEvidence Act 1995(NSW)). Those facts included that Zoya was repeatedly reminded of its obligation to comply withdirection D(ii) by 18 September2020. It was not completed until 29 July 2022.Importantly,during that period, petrolcontinued to leakfrom the fuel suction line from the ULP 1 tank to Bowser 1, 2 every time the pumps at those bowsers were in use during the offence period. Up until 26 July 2022, there was a risk that a potential of 3,210L of petroleum could have leaked from theunderground petroleum storage systems.On 16 December 2022, Moore Jin theLand and Environment Courtconvicted Zoya of a breach of s 14(6)(a) of the CLM Act and fined Zoya $320,000.Under s 46 of the CLM Act, the EPA may give a notice or direction in accordance withparts4.2or4.3 of theProtection of the Environment Operations Act 1997(NSW)(‘POEO Act’) inrelation to significantly contaminated land, as if the EPA were the appropriate regulatory authority within the meaning of that Act. Under s91 of the POEO Act (withinpart 4.2), a regulatory authority may, by notice in writing, direct an owner or occupier of premises at or from which the authority reasonably suspects that a pollution incident has occurred or is occurring, or a person who is reasonably suspected by the authority of causing or having caused or contributing to a pollution incident, to take specified clean-up action.On 7 October 2022, the EPA issued a clean-up notice to Zoya, directing Zoya to take clean-up action, pursuant to s46 of the CLM Act andpart 4.2 of the POEO Act. In the clean­-up notice, the EPA identified that:the EPA reasonably suspected that water pollution had occurred and was occurring; andthe EPA’s review of contamination assessment reports provided to it indicated that there were multiple sources of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at thepetrol station site, including leaks of fuel from the formerunderground petroleum storage systemsand associated fuel infrastructure, a 2010 fuel spill incident during fuel delivery, and spills of fuel on the forecourt of thepetrol station sitethatwerewashed into the stormwater system during rain events, with stormwater discharged to the Seaforthproperty.Sale ofthepetrolstationsiteOn 13 November 2023,Zoya sold thepetrol station siteto RAS Kanwal Group Pty Ltd (‘RAS Kanwal’). The sale price was $600,000, the property having been purchased byZoya in December 2016 for $2,300,000.Upuntil 11 April 2024, when Zoya’s directors, shareholders and registered office changed, Zoya and RAS Kanwal had identical directors, shareholders and registered office.FurthercontaminationDuring its investigation of the Seaforthproperty, Trace identified that the contamination had extended outside thecontaminatedsitebut on the Seaforthproperty. The plume identified by the EPA in thecontaminatedsiteis referred to as“Plume 1”; the extended contamination within the Seaforthproperty discovered later is referred to as“Plume 2”. Trace has undertaken extensive testing,monitoringand reporting in relation to Plume 2. It now considers that Plume 2 is part of the same groundwater contamination plume and from the same contaminationsource as Plume1.Trace also considers that there needs to be anRAP addendum and additional remediation works for the extensivearea of contaminated groundwater in the south­east portion of the Seaforthproperty. Plume 2 is two to three times larger than Plume 1 was prior to remediation anditcontains significantly more light non-aqueous phase liquid.Figures A and B, below, depict the extent of hydrocarbon contamination on the Seaforthproperty. The approximate boundary of the Seaforthproperty is indicated by the solid red line. Figure A shows the level of hydrocarbon contamination on and around the Seaforthproperty prior to Seaforth commencing remedial works. Figure B shows the level of hydrocarbon contamination following the remedial works Seaforth undertook between June and August 2023. The light blue colour represents detectable levels of benzene concentration, with contamination levels increasing in intensity as the colour becomes increasingly red and dark.Figure AFigure BThelaw –nuisanceInRobson v Leischke[2008] NSWLEC 152 at [51]Preston CJ stated:“An occupier of land who knows or ought to know of a nuisance, and the possibility of danger occurring in consequence is a real risk, must take such positive action as a reasonable person, in his position and circumstances, would consider necessaryto eliminate the nuisance.”InGales HoldingsPty Ltd v TweedShireCouncil(2013) 85 NSWLR 514(‘Gales’)at [131] Emmett JA stated:“An occupier of land will be liablefor continuing a nuisance if, with knowledge or presumed knowledge of the state of affairs, the occupier failsto takereasonablesteps to bring it to an end despite having had ample time to do so.”Seaforth’s submissions on nuisanceSeaforth submitted thatZoya was expressly made awareofthe prior nuisance it had caused, and the continuing nuisance that was likely, both by theEPAandbySeaforth.It further submitted that, ratherthan takeremedial actionfor its past nuisance, or preventative action to curtail any further nuisance occurring, Zoya instead deniedresponsibilityandfailed to undertake any reasonable actionover a periodofyears.I agree.DamagesWhere default judgment under r 16.7 of theUCPRis ordered, the matter proceeds to an assessment of damages. That assessment occurs by trial:r 30.1. In other words, Seaforth must establish with evidence its entitlement to the quantum of damages it seeks.Past and future economic lossSections12and 13of theCivil Liability Act 2002(NSW)provides for damages for past or future economic loss.Theyread:12 Damages for past or future economic loss - maximum for loss of earnings etc(1) This section applies to an award of damages:(a) for past economic loss due to loss of earnings or the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, or(b) for future economic loss due to the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, or…….13   Future economic loss—claimant’s prospects and adjustments(1)  A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury.(2)  When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury.(3)  If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted..…”InWinky Pop PTY LTD v Mobil Refining Australia PTY LTD[2015] VSC 348 Digby J stated:“What is the appropriate measure of damages for torts affecting land? In General — diminution in value — reinstatement of costs[136]Fleming’s The Law of Tortsmakes a distinction between damages for harm to the property itself, and damages for consequential loss arising from the harm to the property, including lost business profits.178General damages may also be awarded for the loss of use of the land.179In the case of the harm to the land, despite the widespread impression favouring diminution in value, there is no categorical rule that that is the measure of damages.18° There is a wide range of circumstances that could justify reinstatement over diminution in value, even though reinstatement costs would exceed the diminution in value.181What the court must assess is whether the plaintiffs desire to rebuild, refurbish or be reinstated is reasonable in light of the benefits to the plaintiffs of reinstatement, the extent of the diminution in value and the cost of reinstatement.182For instance, reinstatement may not be reasonable if the costs of reinstatement far outweigh the diminution in value and the plaintiff can purchase a similar property in the open market.183Reinstatement would be reasonable, however, in the case of a plaintiff whose factory has been destroyed and there is no reasonable alternative in which the plaintiff can carry on its business and retain its labour force.184[136] The authors ofLaw of Tortsstate that in cases of nuisance, the principle generally applied is to award the plaintiff the diminution in value of the property brought about by the nuisance.185Moreover, plaintiffs may recover losses that are a reasonably foreseeable consequenceofthe commissionofthe nuisance.186As an alternative to damages for diminution in value, the costsofreinstatement may be recoverable if not out of all proportion to the diminution in value.187[143] InSeiwa Pty Ltd v Owners Strata PlanBrereton J summarised the measure of damages in nuisance as follows:Ordinarily, the proper basis for assessing damages for nuisance is the diminution in value of theplaintiffsland occasioned by the breach. Reasonably foreseeable consequential losses are also recoverable, including for example loss of custom in the case of interruption to a business conducted from the premises, or costs of relocation. Although the cost of restoring the plaintiff’s property to its previous condition may be recoverable — unless there is no prospect of the plaintiff performing the works, or such costs are entirely disproportionate to the diminution in value — that does not extend to performance of works on the land from which the nuisanceemanatesConclusion as to the appropriate measure of damages[182] The cases discussed above indicate that usually, the appropriate measure of damages for injury done to land the diminution in value of the land or the costs of reinstatement, courts will start with what the plaintiff has asked for, and then consider whether that measure of damages is fair and reasonable in light of the injury suffered, the difference between the diminution in value on the one hand and reinstatement costs on the other, and any special value in the land. Damages may also be awarded for consequential losses, including lost profits or lost commercial opportunities. The measure of damages must be approached in a realistic way.[185] I consider, however, that at law and in the circumstances of this case, as addressed in detail beIow,2’the appropriate measure of damages is the diminution in value.[203] An assessment of damages based on diminution of value of the landas a result ofthe contamination injury is, in my view, the much more preferable measure. That is because the alternative sought by the plaintiffs, namely damages for loss of opportunity carries with it a significant risk in this case that the plaintiffs will, or may be, overcompensated because they ultimately develop the land in some way involving residential development. Alternatively, the plaintiffs may well sell their land for a price that factored in potential residential development in the future. This is in my view exacerbated by the way the plaintiffs frame their damages claim. They seek to be compensated on the basis that their residential development plan would have been achieved in all respects as envisaged in relation to cost, timing and scope notwithstanding the many planning and environment vicissitudes which are likely to affect that development, including the resolution of the re-zoning constraintsand alsothe construction and marketing uncertainties. The plaintiffs’compensation involves accepting now, outcomes which would, theoretically, be achieved many years hence and the commercial environment which then exists. Furthermore, the plaintiffs’claim for damages based on their asserted loss of opportunity is by its nature (at this point of time) hypothetical and pregnant with projections and uncertainties whereas the assessment of damages on the basis of the diminution in the value of the plaintiffs’land as a result of the contamination injury caused by Mobil is, for the reasons I have explained, likely to be a more reliable and accurate basis upon which to assess damages.”Plaintiff’ssubmissions oneconomic damagesWhether Zoya’s conduct is conceived of as nuisance or negligence or both, the measure for damages is the same. While an injunction is sometimes sought toremedy a nuisance, that is not the appropriate remedy here, where the nuisance has led to lasting physical damage and Zoya is no longer the owner of thepetrol station site. Seaforth is entitled to be compensated for the loss which it sufferedas a result ofthe relevant conductof Zoya. The kind of harm suffered by Seaforth must have been reasonably foreseeable to Zoya:Galesat [144], [237] (Emmett JA), [276], [280] (Leeming JA), [283] (Sackville AJA). In the case of a tort affecting land, including nuisance, the usual measure of damages is the diminution in value:Winky PopPly Ltd v Mobil Refining Australia Ply Ltd[2015] VSC 348 at [136]-[137] (Digby J) (upheldon appeal: Winky Pop Ply Ltd v Mobil Refining Australia Ply Ltd[2016] VSCA 187 at [331]);Qantas Airways Ltd v Mascot Galvanising (Holdings) Ply Ltd(unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Windeyer J, 17 December 1998);SeiwaPly Ltd v Owners Strata Plan35042 [2006] NSWSC 1157 at [27] (Brereton J).As an alternative, a plaintiff may recover the costs of reinstatement:Winky Popat [137]. Damages may also be awarded for consequential losses:Winky Popat [182];Seiwaat [27]. Damages for reasonableremedial expenditure may be recovered:Delaware Mansions Ltd v Westminster City Council[2002] 1 AC 321.Seaforth has incurred the following expenses since August 2017 in developing the voluntarymanagement proposal, complying with the voluntary management proposal, corresponding with Zoya, and otherwise investigating and remediating the contamination (GST inclusive):Cardno: $39,982.25 between April 2017 and August 2017, when Zoya was informed of the contamination of the Seaforthproperty, and a further $24,967.50 after August 2017;Harwood:$166,147.91.Geo-Logix:$87,579.25Trace: $684,269.30EPA: $2,022.75Seaforth’sSolicitors (excluding fees incurred in pursuing this proceeding, which are a matter for costs): $14,228.50 between December 2016 and August 2017, and a further $232,384.78 after August 2017.The total fees incurred by Seaforth pursuant to the remediation of the Seaforthproperty since December 2016 are$1,226,614.74.The costs incurred since August 2017 are$1,197,371.49.Further, despite Seaforth’s effort and expenditure, the Seaforthproperty remains contaminated. AlthoughPlume 1 has substantially been remediated,Plume 2 has not. Further, despite numerous requests and directions—and despite having been convicted of pollution offences—Zoya did not put in place measures to stop the contamination occurring andcontinued to allow the petrol station operations to be conducted on thepetrol station site. Thepetrol station sitecontinues to contaminate the Seaforthproperty to this day.Mr Kitaof Traceestimates that the costs of completing remediation of the Seaforthproperty will be in the order of $1,060,000 to $1,670,000 (excluding GST). Of course, those are the estimated direct costs, but to properly cost up completion of the remediation it would be necessary tomake adjustmentsfor borrowing costs, risk that the completion of the remediation will not be successful or will be materially more expensive than anticipated, and loss of opportunity to use or invest the funds elsewhere within the business to generate a return. Adjustments to that effect are made by Seaforth’s valuer (see below).The objective of the award of damages is to put Seaforth in the position it would be in if thenuisanceandnegligence had not been committed. In that counterfactual, Zoya would, within a reasonable time of taking possession of the property in December 2016 or at least having been notified of the contamination in August 2017, have investigated the contamination, andimplemented measures to stop the flow of contamination on to the Seaforthproperty.Mr Kita opines that if that had been done (starting in August 2017):the Seaforthproperty would now be fully remediated (Plume 1 andPlume2); andthe cost of fully remediating the Seaforthproperty would be less than half of the costs that will in fact be required to be incurred to fully remediate it (i.e.less than half of the costs to date, which are $1,197,371.49 from August 2017 or $1,226,614.74 from December 2016, plus the $1,060,000 to $1,670,000 yet to be incurred= approximately $2,600,000, half of which is $1,300,000).Therefore, Seaforth’s costs of remediation would be approximately the same as it has spent todate, but it would have a fully remediated site rather than a partially remediated site.Seaforth is entitled to damages for the diminution in the value of the Seaforthpropertyattributable to Zoya’s nuisance and negligence. Damages for the costs of reinstatement are not appropriate, given the uncertainty over how to achieve full remediation and to maintain the Seaforthproperty free of contamination while the contamination of thepetrol station siteisongoingand contamination continues to cross the boundary between the Seaforthproperty and thepetrol station site. Diminution of the value of the Seaforthproperty is a foreseeable kind of harm resulting from the contamination.The appropriate comparison is between the present value of the Seaforthproperty and the value of the Seaforthproperty had Zoya acted reasonably when it purchased the property, or alternatively acted to address the nuisance when it became aware of it and remediated thepetrol station siteand facilitated the remediation of the Seaforthproperty. In the latter scenario, Trace’s opinion is that the Seaforthproperty would have been fully remediated by now. Whilethe property would not be free of hydrocarbon contaminants, the contamination would be such that the Seaforthproperty in its entirety would be suitable for commercial/industrial use.Asoutlined above, remediation ofPlume 1 is virtually complete, but contamination from thepetrol station siteis ongoing, andPlume 2 (having only been discovered later and being considerably larger than the area ofPlume 1) must still be remediated.Seaforth relies on the expertvaluer’sreport of Dean Galanos of Property Logic to quantify the diminution in value of the Seaforthproperty. Mr Galanos inspected the Seaforthproperty on 30 April 2024. Mr Galanos is a commercial real estate executive of 28 years’professional experience who is an Associate of the Australia Property Institute as acertifiedpractisingvaluer.Mr Galanos’opinion is that the contamination of the Seaforthproperty significantly impacts on its value.He opines that planningconsent authorities are“typically circumspect with regards to granting approval for the redevelopment of contaminated sites”and thatlendersin respect of the propertywill likelyonlyprovide finance on less favourable termsthan otherwise,or not at all. Mr Galanos’evidence wasthatpotential (hypothetically prudent) buyers seeking to acquire such an impacted propertymust therefore seek to make contingent allowances for such riskand typically discount such impacted properties accordingly.Contamination can also make it harder for a purchaser to obtain finance. Groundwater contamination sits towards the higher end of the risk spectrum for developers.Mr Galanossuggeststhis is because“contamination can take significant time to materialise, and often despite any initial efforts to remediate and validate the [impacted] land.”In summary, Mr Galanos noted that“theredevelopment of contaminated land is a fraught exercise…”Mr Galanos used thedirectcomparisonmethod to value the Seaforthproperty.This approach involves identifyingcomparable property sale values to establish the property’s current market value.Amongst other things, Mr Galanos had regard to the fact that the Seaforthpropertywas adjacent to a nearby medicalfacility,was“proximateto a strong arterial road transport network”and was of a significant size.When consideringrelevant comparator properties, Mr Galanos concluded that thevalue of the Seaforthproperty, if it were free from contamination,was between $650 to $750 per square metre.Using the midpoint of these values, and rounded for practical purposes, this suggested a market value of$17,000,000.However,some of the contamination ofthe Seaforthpropertyoccurred prior to Zoya’s acquisition ofthepetrol station site. As Seaforth accepted, Zoya is neither responsible nor liable for suchpre-existingcontamination.Consequently, itcontendsthat the appropriatecomparator value for calculating damages was$14,450,000, beingits market value absent any contamination,less a 15% discount to consider the history of contamination.Mr Galanos’assessment is that the Seaforthpropertyin its current stateis worth$7,000,000.Mr Galanos calculated this value using a residual cash flow analysis. The residual cash flow approach determines a price that could be paid for the property given the expected value or sale realisation onceremediated, and the cost, time and charges of proposed works to achieve remediation. As Mr Galanos says, the purpose of this“as is”assessment is“to demonstrate that price that a hypothetical prudent purchaser would pay for the property in its current contaminated state, whilst being fully cognizant of all defects that burden the property (and remediation costs pertaining thereto).”That means the“as is”assessmentconsidersthe current impairment of the Seaforthproperty, including the costs of rectification, andany and allother costs associated with managing and delivering outcomes that restore utility (such as finance costs, professional costs, and holding costs). A“profit and risk”factorisalsoapplied, becausea hypothetical prudent purchaser would seek to achieve a fair and reasonable profit from their enterprise and capital cost outlay.Mr Galanos consideredthat such a purchaser would require a seek a Target Internal Rate of Return of 25%, slightly higher thanthe 20% it would otherwise seek, to reflect the uncertainties associated with re-developing land affected bypetroleumhydrocarboncontamination.Had the Seaforthproperty been fully remediated (as would be the case if Zoya had not committed the torts), the value would instead be$14,450,000.This is based on an assessment that the Seaforthproperty would be worth $17,000,000 if it had never been the subject of contamination (calculated using the direct comparison method), with a discount of 15% applied toconsiderthe history of contamination. That means the diminution in property value attributable to Zoya’s conduct is$7,450,000.It is then necessary to take account of the expenditure that Seaforth would have been required to incur in the counterfactual (where Zoya had stopped contaminating the Seaforthproperty a reasonable time after August 2017)tosell the property on a fully decontaminated basis. Further, as noted above, Seaforth’s costs of decontamination would have been about the same as they are now. Accordingly, no adjustment is required.Although there may be other ways of quantifying Seaforth’s compensable loss, the above would appear to be the most orthodox, since its focus is on the diminution in property value suffered by reason of the nuisanceandnegligence.ResolutionZoya is negligent and has created a nuisance by recklessly allowing the migration of petroleum hydrocarbonsinto the groundfrom its petrol stationto contaminate Seaforth’s land. I agree with the reasoningexplainedearlier in this judgment.Zoya’s negligence and nuisance has caused economiclossandSeaforthis entitled to compensatory damages of $7,450,000.ExemplarydamagesSeaforth seeks exemplary damages in the sumof $1,000,000.InXLPetroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd[1985] HCA 12 471at 11.29 Brenan J stated,“anaward of exemplary damages‘is intended to punish the defendant for conduct showing a conscious and contumelious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights and to deter him from committing like conduct again”In the proceedings brought by the EPA, the court imposed a$320,000 fineon Zoyaon the basis oftwopenalties. The first going towards the breach of s14(6)(a) of theCLMAct and the second being the accumulation of the daily rate of $500 for 352 days.In the judgmentMoore J stated at [13]:“The provision of theCLMAct pursuant to which the prosecutor had commenced proceedings against the company was one which included the option of imposition of a daily penalty from the date of the primary offending conduct, the period pleaded from 19 September 2020 to 6 September 2021 (a period of 352 days) isreferencedas the offence period.”There is some overlap between the proceedings in the Land andEnvironmentCourt and the current proceedings.InEnvironment ProtectionAuthorityv Zoya Investments Pty Ltd[2022] NSWLEC 149, Moore J stated:“Between February 2020 and September 2020, the Company completed all items, other than Direction D, as required by the Management Order. Direction D of the Management Order required the Company to, amongst other things, carry out the following actions:1.D(i) Engage a duly qualified person to carry out equipment integrity checks of the underground petroleum storage system and all associated fuel infrastructure on the land at 68 Craigie Avenue Kanwal, to identify any faulty infrastructure or absence of spill protection / containment measures that may be contributing to contamination… Provide a written report by the duly qualified person detailing their findings to the Prosecutor.2.D(ii) Where operational issues are identified by the duly qualified persons referred to at (i) above, then immediate action must be taken to rectify the problem. Provide a written report by the duly qualified person detailing the work carried out to the Prosecutor.The Management Order required the written report in Direction D(i) to be provided to the Prosecutor by 24 April 2020 and the written report in Direction D(ii) to be provided to the Prosecutor within four weeks of the works being completed or by 19 June 2020 (whichever came first).On 23 April 2020, the Prosecutor issued an Amended Management Order to the Company, unders 44 of the CLM Act, granting the Company a three-month extension to complete Direction D of the Management Order. The Amended Management Order was served on the Company, and a copy sent to theCompany’s engaged consultant, Mr Timothy Brown of Aurora Environmental Consulting Pty Ltd, on 23 April 2020.In July 2020, the Company engaged Neo Consulting Pty Ltd (Neo) to carry out the equipment integrity tests (EIT) of the Underground Petroleum Storage System (UPSS) and all associated fuel infrastructure required by Direction D(i) of the now Amended Management Order. The EIT report was provided to the Prosecutor on 24 July 2020.The EIT report provided by Neo identified failures with respect to the UPSS, including test failures in three of the four petrol storage tanks, and a pinhole leak in the anaconda of the fuel suction line from Unleaded Petrol Tank 1 to Bowsers 1 and 2.The amended compliance‘period to complete Direction D(ii) of the Management Order expired on 18 September 2020.Despite repeated reminders and warnings from its consultants and the Prosecutor, as well as the issue of two“show cause”letters by the Prosecutor, the Company failed to comply with Direction D(ii) of the Management Order during the Offence Period. Such reminders and warnings continued to be given to the Company after the Offence Period.On 16 September 2021, the Prosecutor commenced these proceedings, charging the Company with the failure to carry out the requirements of Direction D(ii) of the Management Order. The Summons commencing the prosecution specified the period throughout which the Company’s offending conduct continued after the date when the period for compliance with Direction D(ii) of the Management Order expired. The period identified in the Summons was from 19 September 2020 to 6 September 2021. The provision of theCLM Actpursuant to which the Prosecutor had commenced proceedings against the Company was one which included the option of imposition of a daily penalty from the date of the primary offending conduct, the period pleaded from 19 September 2020 to 6 September 2021 (a period of 352 days) is referenced as the Offence Period.It was not until 29 July 2022 that the Company carried out the works and provided the written report as required by Direction D(ii) of the Amended Management Order.In relation to environmental harm, up until 26 July 2022, being the date that the vapour recovery pipework was replaced, tested, and passed, there was a risk that a potential 3,210 litres of petroleum could have leaked from the UPSS after 18 September 2020. This risk carried with it the further potential of harm to human health and the environment.There was also the potential for any petroleum leaking into the subsurface of the soil at 70 Craigie Avenue to migrate off site down-hydraulic gradient to the neighbouring property at 70 Craigie Avenue causing further contamination.”InGalesat [279], Leeming JAnoted:“… the fact that exemplary damages are available in an appropriate case [ofnuisance] …”Exemplary damages may be awarded where a defendant has been guilty of conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of another’s rights(Whitfield v De Lauret & Co Ltd(1920) 29 CLR 71 at 771 (Knox CJ)) or has committed a particularlyflagrant violation of Seaforth’s rights(Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren(1966) 117 CLR 185 at 212 (Windeyer J)). If substantial punishment has already been inflicted on the wrongdoer by thecriminal courts for substantially the same conduct, exemplary damages are generally barred:Gray vMotorAccident Commission(1998) 196 CLR 1.Plaintiff’s submissions on exemplary damagesZoya is liable to pay exemplary damages to Seaforth. Zoya’s failure to stop polluting the Seaforthproperty since it was put on notice of the contamination in August 2017 may be described ascontumelious. It has continued todeliberately and flagrantly violate Seaforth’s property rightsby discharging hydrocarbons onto its land. Zoya’s failure to stop the contamination emanating from its property has frustrated Seaforth’s attempts to remediate the Seaforthproperty.Mr Kita’s observation is that the extent of contamination has onlygrownin the past eight years. As Zoya knows, Seaforth is powerless to address the root of the contamination: it has effectively been at Zoya’s mercy.Zoya’s complete disregard for Seaforth’s rights is emphasised by Seaforth’s repeated approaches to Zoya, which have largely been ignored. Seaforth’s lawyers’correspondence with Zoya is detailed at Rush [6J41 1] and [12]-[26]. Zoya’s response to Seaforth’s efforts has been, by and large, to fail to engage. Where it has engaged, that has only been to deny responsibility for the nuisance. Zoya has never accepted to Seaforth that it bears any responsibility for the contamination of the Seaforthproperty, a fact which is obvious and has been since 2017. Zoya’s failure to engage with Seaforth has frustrated its ability to address the nuisance, a circumstance illustrated by the fact that Zoya’s attempts to have a voluntary management proposal approved by the EPA failed because it did not involve Seaforth.The obfuscation of responsibility by Zoya was demonstratedby its most recent response to Seaforth’smany attempts to engage with it. On 28 July 2020, through its legal representative, Zoyaargued that“there is no conclusive evidence”that anyof thealleged contaminationstemmed from thepetrol station site.This was despite an earlier reportcommissioned by Zoya itself,of AuroraEnvironmental Consulting,for the purpose of compliance with the EPA’s management order.Zoya’s own report madethe followingfindings:“Groundwater data indicates that recent releases have occurred and potentially mixed with older releases of petroleum hydrocarbons on the site.[R]ecent tank and line testing… identifies potential significant releases in the current operation of the site infrastructure.[S]ubstantial levels of petroleum have been observed to migrate significantly beyond the extent of the site.[T]he distribution of the highest levels of petroleum hydrocarbon impact indicate that the most significant sources are associated with the operation of the service station.”Zoya’s denialof the apparent was also despitethe management order issued by the EPA to Zoya and the EPA’s findingthat Zoya was responsible for significant contamination of the Seaforthproperty.It was also despite,as early as25 September 2017, having been providedby Seaforthreports fromKPMGand Cardno.Bothdocumentspointed to theservicestationsite as the likely source of the contamination.While Zoya’s inaction has seen it incur a $320,000 fine imposed by the Land and Environment Court, this punishment is only in respect of Zoya’s failure to comply with Direction D(ii) of the management order promptly. This is but a small component of its high-handed disregard for Seaforth’s rights between August 2017 and the present.In November 2023, Zoya sold thepetrol station siteto a closely related entityfora priceof $600,000which was some $1.7 million less than it paid for thepetrol station sitein 2016. The sale was not disclosed to Seaforth. The inference arises that this was donein an attempt toavoid or limit liability, or to protect Zoya’s major asset, thepetrol station site, from Seaforth.Zoya’s reticence to accept its responsibilitiestoSeaforth has only continued as this proceeding has been underway. Since the proceeding was filed in December 2023, Zoya has not participated at all, nor has it evenacknowledged the existence of the proceeding.An award of exemplary damages is appropriate. Seaforth seeks an amount of $1,000,000, which is necessary for the Court to mark its disapproval of the contumaciouswayZoya has violated Seaforth’s rights over a period of between six and seven years.ResolutionZoya’s behaviour demonstrates that it has been guilty of a conscious wrongdoing and a contumelious disregard of Seaforth’s rights. I accept that there is some overlap between these proceedings and the Land and Environment Court’s proceedings where Zoya was fined $320,000 (referredtoearlier in this judgment). Further,Itake into accountthat Zoya purchased the property in 2016,when it was owned by other legal entities, at a time when there had already been some contamination of the Seaforthproperty. However, due to the contumelious disregard of Seaforth’s rights since 2017,when Zoya was made aware of the contamination,anddue to the fact thatthe hydrocarbons continue to contaminate the Seaforthproperty with Zoya doing little to nothing to prevent the continued spread of contaminates, I assessexemplary damages in the sum of$700,000.CostsCosts are discretionary. Normally,costs follow the event.The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of these proceedings on an ordinary basis.ConclusionI award damages calculated as follows,$1,226,614.74constituting of costs associated with the decontamination of the Seaforthproperty as well as legal fees incurred by Seaforth.$7,450,000.00constituting of the diminution in the property’s value.$700,000.00constituting of exemplary damages.Total =$9,376,614.74**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

In response to anyinquiries aboutTillie’s whereaboutsshe lied, including telling people thatTilliehad been adopted.On 16 November 2021,Ms Craigwasarrested in New Zealand and extradited to Australia where she was charged with murder. She has remained in custody,both in New Zealand and NSW,since her arrest.She was due to stand trial forTillie’smurderin the Supreme Court in Katoombaon 22July 2024.On 14 June 2024,MsCraig entered a plea of not guilty toTillie’smurder but guilty to manslaughter.The plea was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment.Ms Craighadoffered to plead guilty to manslaughter in the LocalCourt,but theDirector of Public Prosecutionsdid not accept the pleaat that time. It is common ground thatMs Craigis entitled to a discount of 25% on that basis.[1]As at the time ofTillie’s deaththemaximum penalty for manslaughter was lifeimprisonment. When theSentencing Act1989(NSW)was enacted a few years later and the concept of“truth in sentencing”introduced,themaximum penalty for manslaughter was reduced to 25 years imprisonment. Byoperation of s431A of theCrimes Act1900(NSW), Ms Craig is to be sentenced on the basis that themaximum penaltyfor manslaughteris25 yearsimprisonmentrather than life imprisonment.The significant delayof 37 yearssincethe commission of the offenceraises a number of issues relevant toher sentence.Although, at common law,asentencing court would berequired to sentenceMs Craigin accordance with the sentencing patterns and practices at the time of the offence,on18 October 2022 s21Bof theCrimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act1999(NSW)(“the Sentencing Act”) was enacted which provides thatsuch an offenderis to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing patterns and practices for manslaughteras at the dateof sentence. I shall consider the application of that provision to Ms Craig’s sentence later in these reasons.To say that the circumstances of Tillie’s death are tragic would be a grossunderstatement. She died at the hands of someone whose role it was to protect her. Her father was unable to prevent her deathand did noteven know she had died untilMs Craig was arrested.One of thecentral issuesrelevant to the appropriate sentence for Ms Craig is theextent, if any,to whichMs Craig’s sentence should be amelioratedbecauseat thetimeshekilled her daughterher belief system appears to have been warped by the values espousedby The Family,in particular as to her role asTillie’smother.The Crown accepted that it was open to concludethat hadMs Craignot joinedThe Familyshe would not have killed Tillie.Ms Craighad no cognitive impairment or mental illness at the time of the offending thatwascausative of the offending. Nor is there any evidence that Ms Craig had beenviolent to Tilliebefore her death, although she knew that the cult leaderhad violently disciplinedher.My role in sentencing Ms Craig is to identify and consider all factors relevant to the sentence, both objective and subjective, and ultimately make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors in the case.[2]I may notmake findingsadverse to the interests ofMs Craigunless they are established beyond reasonable doubt, whilst it is sufficient ifmattersthat are favourable to herare established on the balance of probabilities[3].If I am unable tomade findingsto either of those standards,I do not propose to do so.[4]Agreed FactsAgreed Facts were tendered on 14 June 2024.Although they are lengthy,I consider it appropriate toextractthemin fullverbatim. The AgreedFactsarein the following terms.BackgroundMs Craigwas born on 28 March 1962 in New Zealand.In early 1984,Ms Craigwas living in Lismore, New South Wales. At about this time, she met Gerard Stanhope.Ms CraigandMrStanhope commenced a relationship and began living together. Within about two months of the relationship commencing,Ms Craigwas pregnant.The relationship betweenMs CraigandMrStanhope was tumultuous. They broke up and re-engaged several times during its currency.On 10 December 1984,Ms Craig(then aged 22) gave birth to a daughter, Tillie Craig, the deceased. When Tillie was born, she,MsCraigandMrStanhope (then aged 35) lived together in Lismore.Ms Craigtravelled with Tillie to New Zealand in December 1985 and again on 11 September 1986. Upon her return,Ms Craiglived in the same house asMrStanhope, but she andMrStanhope had separated.Sometime in late November 1986,Ms CraigtoldMrStanhope that she had met some people in Sydney and was planning to take Tillie and live with them in the Blue Mountains. She did not give any further details of who these people were and where she was planning to live.MrStanhope would not allowMs Craigto take Tillie to live with unknown people and the two arranged forMs Craigto go on her own.Ms Craigleft for a number of weeks and did not communicate withMrStanhope, who was caring for Tillie during this time.Ms Craigdid not call on 10 December 1986, which was Tillie’s second birthday.MrStanhope called a number whichMs Craighad left him and spoke to her. She told him that she would be back in a few days.Ms Craigreturned toMrStanhope’s home on 12 December 1986. She immediately began packing her belongings and said toMrStanhope,“I’m taking my daughter and going to live in the Blue Mountains”. An argument ensued inwhichMrStanhope slappedMs Craigacross the face. Police were called and it was decided that Tillie would remain withMrStanhope. At her request,Ms Craigwas taken to the railway station by police.Later that day,MrStanhope was with Tillie when he sawMs Craig. The two spoke and it was decided thatMs Craigwould return home. That night,Ms CraigtoldMrStanhope that she had decided she was leaving Lismore.MrStanhope put Tillie to bed. Later that evening,Ms Craigleft the house with Tillie and ended up at a women's refuge. WhenMrStanhope discovered they were gone, he drove around looking for them.The next day,MrStanhope was contacted by Ms TZ, a friend ofMs Craig, who told him thatMs Craigand Tillie were at the refuge.MrStanhope rang the refuge but was told that the two were not there.The following day, 15 December 1986,MrStanhope received information thatMs Craigwas at the courthouse. He went there and saw her with Tillie.Ms Craigwould not speak toMrStanhope. She saw the Chamber Magistrate, who set down an interim hearing on 18 December 1986. On that date,MrStanhope andMs Craigreached an agreement thatMs Craigwould have“care and control”of Tillie and thatMrStanhope would have“reasonable access”to the child.Ms Craigrefused to tellMrStanhope where she would be living, but she provided him with a post office box number at the Queen Victoria Building in Sydney and a phone number.Ms SM was a friend ofMs Craigfrom New Zealand. At some point,she visitedMs Craigin Lismore when Tillie was living withMs Craigthere.Ms Craigtold SM thatMrStanhope was a drug and alcohol user, that he wanted custody of Tillie, and that she wanted to get away from him.WhenMrStanhope had not seen Tillie for a week, he attempted to call the numberMs Craighad given him, but it was disconnected. He wrote a letter toMs Craigsaying that he would be in Sydney on 13 January 1987 and expected her to honour their arrangement.Ms CraigcalledMrStanhope and told him thatshe would bring Tillie to him on 13 January 1987. Before this date,Ms CraigcalledMrStanhope and told him that she and Tillie were living in the Blue Mountains and that he would have to wait another week to see Tillie. By this time,MrStanhope had moved to Ashfield, in Sydney.On 26 January 1987,Ms Craigbrought Tillie toMrStanhope in Ashfield. While bathing her,MrStanhope noticed that she had bruises and scratches on both her legs and one or both of her arms.MrStanhope thought the bruises appeared to be old.The following day,Ms Craigreturned to collect Tillie.MrStanhope invited her in, but she refused, instead sitting in a van for about 10 minutes.Ms Craigeventually did enter the house but was uncommunicative.MrStanhope asked her,“How did she get bruises and scratches on her?”Ms Craigreplied,“The bruises and scratches were from Tillie falling down and from the dogs jumping on her”.MrStanhope decided not to press the issue further and to see how Tillie was during the next visit.MrStanhope never saw Tillie again.AfterMs Craigleft with Tillie,MrStanhope tracked down Mr PF, the then-husband of Ms CF who owned the vanMs Craighad used. PF gaveMrStanhope a telephone number for the property whereMs Craigwas living.MrStanhope called the number and spoke toMs Craig. He told her that he would not attend the property unless invited and would only call again after she contacted him.On30 January 1987,Ms Craigtravelled to New Zealand with Tillie.MrStanhope waited two weeks and had not heard fromMs Craig, so he called the number again. He asked forMs Craig, but the phone was given to AlexanderWilon.MrWilonsaid to him words to the effect,“Ellen [the offender] told me that when you last spoke to her that you threatened to come out here and get Tillie”.MrStanhope denied this. He did not speak toMs Craig. Over the next month or so,MrStanhope rang the number two or three more times and each time spoke toMrWiloninstead ofMs Craig. During one of these calls,MrWilonsaid words to the effect,“Ellen told me that you weren’t Tillie’s father”and“Tillie was a badly behaved girl when she first arrived here, but we brought her back into line”.On 6 February 1987,MrStanhope received a letter fromMs Craigin New Zealand. The letter conveyed that she had taken Tillie and thatMrStanhope would never see her again. She also said that Mr PR was Tillie’s father, notMrStanhope, and thatMrStanhope had forced her to put his name on the birth certificate. The letter also claimed that he had terrorised her for four hours when she came to collect Tillie from Ashfield on 27 January 1987.PR was in a relationship withMs Craigat the time that she andMrStanhope met in 1984. Prior to Tillie’s birth,Ms Craighad met with PR and told him that she was afraid ofMrStanhope as he was violent, and she was going to tell everyone that he (PR) was the baby’s father.PR toldMs Craigthat he was not the baby’s father, and that he would not go along with it.On 20 February 1987,Ms CraigcalledMrStanhope. She said words similar to,“I am offering you a deal. I want to go back to the Blue Mountains to live and I will let you see Tillie when it is convenient to me. You have to agree to allow Tillie to remain in my custody and you can’t have a say on how I bring Tillie up”.MrStanhope refused.Ms Craigtold him she would call again in two days and then hung up.On 19 April 1987,Ms Craigagain calledMrStanhope and offered the same conditions for permitting him contact with Tillie. This time,MrStanhope agreed.Ms Craigsaid,“Write me a letter saying that you won’t dispute my custody application and that you would withdraw yours. If you do this, I will return from New Zealand within three weeks”.MrStanhope complied, sending the letter the same day.On 5 May 1987,MrStanhope received a letter fromMs Craig, rejecting his letter and asking him to send another one through his solicitor agreeing to herconditions.MrStanhope did not reply and decided to wait for the next court date at Lismore in June.On 24 June 1987,MrStanhope attended court in Lismore for the custody hearing.Ms Craigdid not attend. The matter was transferred to Sydney. After the hearing,MrStanhope calledMs Craig’sparents’house in New Zealand. He spoke withMs Craigand asked what her plans were. She did not want to tell him.MrStanhope told her that if she were staying in New Zealand, he would move there.On 1 July 1987,Ms Craigand Tillie returned to Australia from New Zealand.In late June or early July 1987, PF toldMrStanhope that CF had been charged with assaulting MF (their daughter) and he now had full custody of his daughters. PF sentMrStanhope copies of some documents which included photographs and a diagram of the injuries to MF. Within a few daysMrStanhope commenced legal proceedings to obtain custody of Tillie.“The Family”In 1985, Ms EM was living at Kiama. During a trip to Sydney, she metAlfioNicolosi, a self-styled religious leader who was later known as AlexanderWilon. After a lengthy conversation, she stayed that night at his residence in Bondi. They kept in touch and she moved into his residence in December 1985. While she lived there, she saw people visiting and being given spiritual guidance byMrWilon. Among the visitors toMrWilon'sresidence in Bondi wasMs Craig, thefirst timebeing November 1986.Ms CraigmetMrWilonthrough a friend from New Zealand, Ms HJ.MrWilonbegan talking about moving to the country. In December 1986,MrWilon(then aged 35) and EM (then aged 19) moved to a property at 322 Claytons Road, Porters Retreat, approximately 40 minutes from Oberon. On the property, there were two dwellings. One was known as the main house or main cottage, in whichMrWilonlived and where he had a room with a bed and a desk, known as“Papa’s Room”. The room was used for compulsorymeditation and prayer by the group, andMrWilonslept there. The second cottage was used for cooking and preparing food. Also living at the property from December 1986 wereMs Craig, Tillie, Ms HJ, Mr YR and Mr DB.Ms Craigcame and went from the property and was nottherefull time. The group was known as“The Family”or“The Community of Eden”. Other people visited the property throughout 1987, including Ms JT and her sons DT and JT, Ms SF, and Ms CF (the wife of PF) and her daughters MF and SF.Ms Craigand Tillie moved to the farm around December 1986. The Family were told thatMs Craigwas a victim of domestic abuse at the hands ofMrStanhope.MrWilonreceived money from members of The Family and controlled what it was spent on.MrWilondirected his“followers”to call him“MasterWilon”. Life at the property became more regimented and controlled byMrWilonas time went on.MrWilonand his followers engaged in meditation four times each day for approximately 30 to 60 minutes at a time. These meditation sessions differed. Sometimes a meditation was played, other timesMrWilonwould just talk, or he would relay what his“guide”“Monet”would say to him.MrWilonused crystals and would“read”his followers’minds and tell them what to do.Followers had to do as they were told byMrWilon. For example, they had to attend the meditations in“Papa’s Room”, eat at specific times and follow strict routines. Members of The Family were not permitted to questionMrWilonor each other, or to speak out. The members of The Family were isolated and kept very separate from society; they were not allowed to interact with outsiders.MrWilon“disciplined”the followers for perceived failures to comply with his rules,directionsor desires, and they were the subject of physical violence by him, which included beatings with fists and pieces of plastic pipe. Some of the beatings were prolonged. He also beat the dogs that were kept at the property.MrWilonengaged in sexual activity with the women at the property, as well as with a young man who lived there. Occasionally,he would involve multiple sexual partners. Sexual activity involved“MasterWilon”telling members of the group to go into“Papa's Room”, where he would engage in sexual activity withthem. On several occasions,he travelled to Sydney and took women from the community, stayed at ahoteland had sex with them there. From time to time,MrWilonwould have sex withMs Craig. YR said that at one pointMrWilonsuggested that YR,Ms Craigand Tillie become a family. YR said,“I really don’t want to”.MrWilonstared athimand said,“If you don’t like it, you can get out”. YR left The Family at that point.Followers ofMrWilon, including YR, said thatMrWiloncontrolled their actions and thoughts with techniques of fear,reprisalsand negative reinforcement. YR said he reached the stage that he believed everythingMrWilonsaid, wanted and did was totally right. YR said thatMrWilontold his followers that“your ego must be completely destroyed”and that his followers must humble themselves before him.EM was a devout follower ofMrWilonand was the subject of a number ofWilon’sphysical assaults. If told to do something, EM had to comply otherwise she may be beaten. Sometimes he hit her with his fists, other times with a stick. On one occasion, MrWilonkicked her and then a dog started biting her. Leftover portions of 12-15mm thick, black plastic irrigation tubing were lying around at different locations at the property and were used to punish members.MrWiloncut off lengths of this tubing for this purpose.MrWiloneffectively made EM his second in charge, and this meant that if someone else did something wrong, she would be punished.At some point prior to the death of Tillie,MrWilonwrote a manifesto, titled“TheCommunity of Eden”, which outlined the rules and principles by which The Family lived. He distributed this document to members of The Family. There were consequences for not adhering to the rules such as being expelled from the community and, after moving to the country, physical punishment. The manifesto discouraged mourning or funeral ceremonies following a death and espoused immediate cremation of the body.Under the influence ofMrWilon, members of The Family were required to physically discipline the children. In particular,MrWilon'sorders to disciplinethe children were directed at the mothers of the children. The mothers faced discipline as well if their child misbehaved. The children were smacked, hit with the black irrigation piping, and hit with a long scrubbing brush.MrWilonalso personally disciplined Tillie and verbally abused her. Almost daily, he dragged Tillie into the bathroom and hit her with a long wooden back brush, sometimes many times. He would demand that she stop crying and would hit her more if she did not stop. On one occasion, during a prayer meeting,MrWilonhit Tillie in the face with the back of his hand because she did not look at him when told to do so. Tillie sustained a black eye. Tillie had bruises on her buttocks and also on her arms from being dragged byMrWilon. YR witnessedMrWilonchastising Tillie and saying,“look at the ego in her, look at the evil in her”. He also witnessedMrWilonsaying,“this child needs discipline, she is spoilt and her ego is too strong”.On occasion, MrWilonalso disciplined MF and SF, the daughters of CE, by smacking them in the bathroom. On one particular occasion,MrWilonhit MF severely and caused welts to appear on her body.Death of TillieOn 7 July 1987,MrWilonhad gone to Bathurst, while EM,Ms Craigand Tillie remained at the property. Children were required to do chores on the property, regardless of their age. Tillie was required to sweep the pathway between the cottages. EM was in the kitchen in the second cottage and could see out of the window and hearMs Craigwith Tillie.Unhappy at Tillie’s sweeping,Ms Craigbegan yelling at Tillie and hitting her on the legs and, at some stage, on the back, with a length of the black plastic irrigation tubing that had been left nearby byMrWilonfor the purpose of discipline. At first,Tillie was just standing there. At some point,EM heard Tillie crying.EM went to the main house which was 15-20 metres away, passingMs Craigand Tillie on the path as she went.Shedid not intervene, and continued walkingto the main house, where she remained for a short time. EM then went back into the second cottage to continue her chores, again passing Tillie andMs Craigon the path. She again sawMs Craighitting Tillie, who was now lying face down on the ground.Ms Craigwas hitting Tillie on her back and legs while she was on the ground.EM had never witnessedMs Craighit Tillie before.After a short time,Ms Craigcame inside and said words to the effect,“She’s stopped breathing”. EM andMs Craigwent outside to where Tillie was lying on the ground.Ms Craigpicked Tillie up and it appeared Tillie made a noise.Ms Craigsaid,“Oh no”. The noise was air from Tillie’s lungs. She was unresponsive and was not moving or breathing.Ms Craigsaid,“Oh no, no she’s gone”.Ms Craigpicked Tillie up and tried to resuscitate her.Ms Craigand EM went over to the main house andMs Craiglaid Tillie in the empty bathtub. They undressed Tillie and inspected her body. There was no visible bleeding.Ms Craigand EM went into“Papa’s Room”and prayed and meditated. Neither EM norMs Craigcalled for emergency services or assistance. They waited there for between 30 minutes and two hours.Tillie died during the act ofMs Craighitting her with a length of irrigation tubing. It is not known which blow caused Tillie’s death, or precisely how Tillie died. The act was excessive discipline. It was unlawful and dangerous. There was no intention on the part ofMs Craigto cause grievous bodily harm or death to Tillie.Disposal of Tillie’s bodyMrWilonreturned to Porters Retreat at some point in the afternoon. EM met him and said,“Tillie’s dead”. EM showedMrWiloninto the bathroom where Tillie’s body lay.MrWilonheld his hands over the body and prayed in an attempt to resurrect her. While in the bathroom,MrWilonalso talked about having connected with Tillie’s soul that morning and noticed that Tillie’s“ego was low”and that her soul was telling him it was about to leave this planet.MrWilontalked toMs Craigand EM about what to do with Tillie’s body. The suggestion was made that they should take Tillie up into the forest and bury her. AtWilon’srequest, EM assembled shovels, picks and mattocks and they all got into a four-wheel-drive, whichMrWilondrove. Tillie’s body was wrapped in a white sheet. They went up into the forest surrounding the property and there was a clearing where they stopped. At this point, it was decided that Tillie would be cremated instead. They returned to the house with Tillie’s body, still wrapped in a white sheet. It was still light.MrWilontook Tillie’s body to an area out the back of the garage where there were some 44-gallon drums which were, on occasion, used to burn off other items.MrWilonplaced Tillie in one of the drums along with wood, oldclothesand motor oil.MrWilonlit the fire in the drum. Once the flames were lit,MrWilonsent EM andMs Craigaway.MrWilonstood over the drum whilst it burned and continued to put wood, oldclothesand old motor oil on the fire. The fire burned for hours. He burnt the body until there was nothing left. At some point, when EM took food or drink out toMrWilon, he talked about“God's laws, not man’s laws”applying to The Family at the property, and that he was protectingMs Craigas a child of God.MrWilonalso again talked about having connected with Tillie’s soul that morning, and her soul was telling him it was about to leave this planet. WhileMrWilonwas outside burning the body, EM andMs Craigdid not talk or interact; as was usual, they were not permitted to be social or to“chitchat”.The next day, when the ashes and drum had cooled,MrWilonasked EM to get him a sieve and a hammer. EM retrieved a large metal sieve, used for prospecting, andMrWilonsent her away again. He then sifted through the ashes, using the sieve to make sure there were no unburnt remains. Some of the ashes blew away and over the ground.MrWilonalso scattered some of the ashes in the river that runs around the back of the property, called Little River.MrWilondirected EM to help him carry the drum and they threw it in the river. The drum sank and has not been found.MrWilondisposed of the body within 24 to 30 hours ofMs Craighitting Tillie.Following Tillie’s deathAfter Tillie’s death,MrWilonprohibited his followers from talking about what happened. He said that if anyone asked after Tillie, they were to be told that she was given up for adoption. After a visit to Sydney, when CF returned to Porters Retreat,Ms Craigand Tillie were no longer there. She overheard another resident saying that Tillie had been adopted by a couple somewhere else in NSW. JT was also told that Tillie had been adopted by a couple at the Central Coast. When JT was told this,Ms Craigwas still living at the property. During a meditation session at which DT was present,MrWilontold the group that Tillie had moved back to New Zealand to live with her father. During another meditation session,MrWilonsaid that Tillie’s father“wasn’t budging”on custody and thatMs Craigneeded to go back to New Zealand to be close to Tillie. A few days later,Ms Craigleft the property.On 1 August 1987,MrStanhope came to the property occupied by The Family with PF and another man.MrWilonorderedMs Craigto hide and to ensure she was not seen. Doing as she wastold,Ms Craighid under the bed in Papa’s Room.MrWilonwent running to the gate and was yelling at PF.MrStanhope walked pastMrWilonand into the second cottage, but Tillie was not inside. They came back outside, andMrStanhope spoke toMrWilon, who told him,“Tillie isn’t here and don’t come back for her”.MrWilonwould not let them inside the other house. The police arrived and toldMrStanhope and his companions to leave as they were trespassing. Thepolice went into Papa’s Room and had a look around but did not look under the bed or in cupboards and so did not findMs Craig.On 6 August 1987,MrStanhope obtained an order from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, preventingMs Craigfrom removing Tillie from New South Wales. An airport watch was put in place.On 8 August 1987,MrStanhope and PF drove to Porters Retreat.MrStanhope spoke toMrWilon, who said thatMs Craigwas no longer living there.MrStanhope planned to camp in the surrounding bush in an attempt to see eitherMs CraigorTillie, but abandoned this idea when his presence roused the dogs and he saw men with rifles. He did not seeMs Craigor Tillie.MrStanhope travelled to Lismore in an attempt to find Tillie. He stayed there for about a month. Before leaving, he spoke toMrWilon, who told him that he had metMs Craigand her new boyfriend in Bondi and that Tillie was not with them.On 25 September 1987, a court order was made granting care and custody of Tillie toMrStanhope.On one occasion,MrWilonwas away and called the property on a fax line that had been installed. EM answered the phone, and during the conversation she toldMrWilon,“Oh I’ve had lots of thoughts about Tillie”.MrWilonbecame angry and upset and said words to the effect,“Imagine if someone was listening in to this line. Thank God I called on the fax line so no-one would hear this.”At some point before 3 November 1987,Ms Craigwas expelled from The Family byMrWilon.On 3 November 1987,Ms Craigflew to New Zealand alone. AfterMs Craigleft for New Zealand,MrWilontold EM thatMs Craigwould not be able to come back into the country because the police would be looking for her, trying to find Tillie. In the context of that conversation,MrWilontold EM that he did this because he was God’s servant, they were God’s children, and it was his responsibility to protect them.On 16 November 1987,Ms Craigofficially changed her name in New Zealand toJowelleTenzingSmith. Her family in New Zealand worried about her because they did not know where she was and could not contact her. She was“missing”for a period oftwo to threeyears.Throughout 1988,MrStanhope continued in his attempts to locate Tillie. Articles in the media did not generate any information as to her whereabouts.Sometime after May 1988,Ms Craigvisited family in Auckland. During that visit, she spoke with her niece, BE. She said that Tillie was safe and that she had left her with another family, and not to worry about her as she was safe.In January 1990,MrStanhope enlisted the help of his friend,Ms TZ,to travel with him to New Zealand in an attempt to locate Tillie. On 16 February 1990, TZ met withMs Craig. She told TZ that she and Tillie left Porters Retreat after an incident with CF and PF’s children. She said that she and Tillie travelled to New Zealand and stayed at a resort. She said that during this stay, she gave Tillie to a South African couple who were also holidaying there, having sailed toSydneyand flown to New Zealand. TZ relayed this story toMrStanhope.On one occasion in the 1990s,Ms Craigspoke toMrStanhope on the phone. On another occasion, in about 1993, BE askedMs Craigwhether she had told her then-boyfriend about Tillie, andMs Craigrefused to answer the question.In 1995, BE again askedMs Craigabout Tillie, andMs Craigsaid thatTiIliewas safe and there was no need to worry about her.Ms Craig’ssister, last saw Tillie when she visited New Zealand withMs Craigin 1986.Sheattempted to speak toMs Craigon numerous occasions about Tillie, butshebecame evasive and distracted, diverting to a different topic.On 19 May 1997,Ms Craigofficially changed her name fromJowelleTenzingSmith back to Ellen Rachel Craig, though she had resumed using that name some years earlier.EM approaches policeEM remained at Porters Retreat withWilonand others until 12 December 2014, when she left the property and The Family. On 12 October 2019,she attended the first day of a workshop for cult survivors run by Cult Information and Family Support. She did not speak about Tillie’s death at the course, but realised she had to talk to someone about it. That evening, EM called the police from a public telephone to report the matter.Arrest ofMs CraigAt 7am on 16 November 2021,Ms Craigwas arrested by New Zealand Police. When she was placed under arrest she said,“Oh no. Oh no. Right, so. Oh OK.”Ms Craigtook part in an official interview. While talking about being naive and“influenced”at the“retreat”, she said,“I think something happened...I don’t know. But I was, something was, I was not, I was completely out ofmy, myselfmy character...I completely, I don’t know what I was doing.”When asked to talk about Tillie she said,“I don't think I can at the moment. I want to say all of these things...but I just...I don’t...”When again asked what happened with Tillie,Ms Craigagain said,“I can’t, I don’t, I can’t, I, I...I don’t know what happened. I can’t tell you...what happened.”Ms Craigconfirmed that she had changed her name when she returned to New Zealand and stated that she was“advised to do that...[by] people at the retreat”. She said she did not know why she was advised to change her name; it was not her idea.Ms Craigremembered EM. She described her asMrWilon’sprotegee or lieutenant and said she“did anything and ... she was, ah, like, in charge ...”When asked again what happened to Tillie, and details of the allegations were put toMs Craig, she remained silent.Ms Craigwas extradited back to Australia. She has been in custody since 16 November 2021.Proceedings on sentenceThe Crown tendered a bundle comprisingaCrownSentenceSummary,aStatement of Agreed Facts,two photographs of Tillie,the offender’s criminal history(NSW and New Zealand) and custodial history, andaVictimImpactStatement fromTillie’s father,Gerard Stanhope,dated 1 August 2024.Documents tendered onbehalf of Ms Craigcompriseda letterfrom MsCraig dated 5 August 2024,tworeports from Dr Katie Seidler, clinical and forensic psychologist, dated 5 April 2023 and 30 July 2024,a manifesto by AWilon“God and the People of the Community of Eden”,extracted Justice Healthmaterials,a document published by theWorld Health OrganisationonChronic ObstructivePulmonary Disease (COPD),anextract from“COPD and the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis”,anextract fromaCorrective Services document“Going to Prison”related to SMAP(Special Management and Protection Unit),andextracts and sentencing submissions fromthe Judicial Commissionpertaining toHomicides inNSW1990-2001.Defence counsel also sought to tender three additional documents. One was a report from ToreKlevjer, president of Cult Information and Family Support,dated 2 August 2024 and the other two were academic articles about cults in the Unites States of America: Langone & Eisenberg“Children and Cults”and Markowitz & Halperin,“Cults and Children–Abuse of the Young”. The Crown objected to these documents oneitherrelevance (the USAacademicarticles)orlack of expertise (MrKlevjer’sreport). It was submittedon behalf of Ms Craigthat this material was relevant to establish thatshehad effectively been brainwashedand this wasrelied upon asa mitigating factor.After hearing submissions,I indicated to the parties at the time that I was satisfied that there wassufficientmaterial about theworkings of The Familyin theAgreedFacts, themanifesto and Dr Seidler’s reportsto support the finding sought by the offender. On that basis,the tender was rejected.Ms Craig did not give evidence on sentence and no witnesses were called.VictimImpactStatementMr Stanhope read his Victim Impact Statement to thecourt. Hedescribedhis hope that hewould find his daughterone day. He also described hisfeeling of devastation that he was unable to.It wasmore than30 yearsbefore hebecame awarethatTilliewasalready goneandthat shehadlost her life at the hands of her own mother,“the person she should have been able to trust to protect her the most”.Mr Stanhope described the pain of losing a child as“indescribable”and awound that never heals. Hisgrief has“pervaded every aspect of [his] life formany years”. He described how hishope that he and Ms Craig would work out a way to bothbepresentin their daughter’s life faded when it became apparent to him that Ms Craig had no intention of doing so and refused to tell him where in the Blue Mountainsthey lived. He spent years trying to find them,having moved from Lismore to Sydneyin order to do so.Mr Stanhope eloquentlydescribedbeing haunted by two things.The first of these waswhenhe observedthebruises and scratches onTillie’sbodythe last time that he saw her. He sawhow anxious she was when she soiled her nappy. He described how he insisted on getting a reasonable explanation from Ms Craigabout the bruises and scratcheswhen she came to collectTilliethe next day. HegaveMs Craigthebenefit of the doubt when she told him that the scratches and bruises were a result of the“playful jumping”of the dogs on the property.Hecarried Tillie toMs Craig’s van while she was struggling and crying because she did not want to go. Hecould not have known that thiswould be the last time he wouldeversee her.He describes how“to this day I carry a sense of guilt that I didn’t listen to what she was trying to tell me in the only way she could”.The second thing that still haunts Mr Stanhopestems from the factthat the day after he last saw Tillie,Ms Craig tookher toNew Zealandfor about six months. Tilliewould be killed within a week of them returningto Australia.Whatstill hauntsMr Stanhopeis“trying to imagine the sheer terror Tillie must have felt when she realised that her mother was delivering her back into the hell that had been her life six months earlier”.Section 30E(1) of the Sentencing Act provides that when a victim impact statement is tendered in relation to an offence, the court must consider the statement and may make any comment on the statement that the court considers appropriate.Section 30E(3) of the Sentencing Act provides that a victim impact statement of a family victim may be taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of a primary victim’s death on family victims is an aspect of harm done to the community. Thecourtcan only take such astatement into account in this way if the Crownapplies for this to occur, and the court considers it to be appropriate.The Crown made such an application in this case.TheSentencing Actdoesnotexplain how thecourt is to determine when it is“appropriate”toconsiderthe impact of the offence on the deceased’s family as harm done to the communityand when it is not.On one view,every unlawful death causes harm to the community and to the family of the personkilled. Despite this, having heard from Mr Stanhope,it is clear thatthe circumstances ofTillie’s deathhavehad a devastating impact onhimand no doubt on friends and family.I am ultimately satisfied that the harm expressed by Mr Stanhopeas a parent of a young childis an aspect of the harm done tothecommunity and I have taken it into account in connection withthe determinationof the appropriate punishment.It isoften observed in sentencing matters involving the death of a personthatno sentenceof imprisonmentcanadequately reflect the loss of a dear family member. Thatisparticularlyso when the death is ofatwo-year-oldchild with her whole life ahead of her. On behalf of the court, I extend my sincere condolences toMr Stanhope and other extended family members ofTillieCraig.Additional material about “The Family\"In addition to the material about The Family included in the Agreed Facts, the offender relied uponportions ofthemanifesto of the Community of Eden includingthe following passage:“Great importance is placed on checking the abilities of each person to be a goodparent. Every potential parent is to satisfy the Servant of theLord or the member of the Ministry, that they are both able to raise a child with the utmost disciplineand care, both physically and emotionally.All members of the community are aware that to have even one child brought up by incapableparentswouldjeopardisethe safety of the community. For this reason,coupleswelcome theopinion ofthe servant of the Lord. He is there to safeguard not only their happiness but the happiness of the entire community.”Themanifestoalsoincluded a section headed“Rules of Conduct for the Members of God’s Community of Eden”which included the following rules in relation to children:“C1)You shall not terminate a conception.C2)You shall not assume possession over your children. All children belong to the Lord God.C3)You shall partake in the responsibility for the care,upbringingand discipline of all the children in the community.C4)The Lord God commands you to raise all children to be humble, disciplined, caring and respectful.C5)You shall be fully responsible and accountable for the behaviour of the children.”In addition to this material, the offender went into some detail with Dr Seidler aboutthe circumstances of her joiningThe Family.She explained that she met some peoplein Sydneywho were“getting in touch with spirit guides”including MrWilon. He invited her to join him at a property in the country. MrWilontold her to go to New Zealand which she did and then she returned when he directed her to.Ms Craig described how MrWilonwas“into punishment”and she witnessed him beating Tilliefor discipline. She was aware of this and didnothing to intervene. She said that she was only at the retreat for a few monthsand got caught up in this“whole thing about talking to God”and that MrWilontold them that they needed to be“trainedupfor this big thingthat will happen in theworld,and we wouldneed to be in contact with our guides”. MrWilonwas not violent to her but controlled her movements includingdirectingher who to have sex with. She was afraid of him.She also told Dr Seidler that she consideredMrWilon’sbehaviour towards Tillie to be abusive. She did not feel like she could leave the retreat as she had no money and was reliant on MrWilonas well as having no idea where she mightgo if sheleft.Dr Seidleralso opined that Ms Craig’sSchizoidPersonalityDisorder would have predisposed her to some attraction for MrWilon’sideas.The offender’s account of theoffence to Dr SeidlerMs Craig toldDrSeidlerthat she beat Tillie with apieceofplastic piping,and shecontinuedto assaultTillie until the child wasunresponsiveand ultimately stopped breathing. She told DrSeidlerthat sheneverexpected thatTillie might die as a result of the physical abuse she meted out. She described how she“went into shock”and did not have any feelings when sherealisedTillie had died and she was unable to resuscitate her. She denied that she was trying toimpressMrWilonwith herphysicalabuse of Tillie on the day she died.She felt she was doing what was expected ofher giventhe violence around her asmetedout by MrWilon.Objective seriousnessThe starting point for assessing the objective seriousnessin this matter is thatevery case of manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life. That is the starting point for the consideration of the appropriate penalty and a key elementin assessing thegravity of the conduct.[5]Tilliediedafterbeingcontinually struckon herlegs and body with a piece ofplastic irrigation piping. The assault was prolonged.As the AgreedFacts disclose, the witness EM observed portionsof the assaultfrom a window, walked from where shewas to the main house, remained there for a short time and then returnedduring which time the assault continued. Tillie was crying.Ms Craigcontinued to assault Tillie until she wasunresponsiveand ultimately stopped breathing. She was lying face down on the ground by that time.The mechanism of how Tillie diedwill never be known. Her body was burned to destroy the evidence. No post mortem could ever be conducted. Although it was submitted on behalf of Ms Craig that Tillie may have fallen down and hither head, it seems to me that is pure speculation.But norisit open to me to find that she was struck on the head as that is not included in the AgreedFacts.The motive for the killing was that Ms Craig was unhappy with the way in whichtwo-year-oldTillie was sweeping a path.The AgreedFacts do not disclose that Ms Craig was angry, frustrated, provoked or unable to cope with the demands of parenthood.Nordid she describe her offending in that way to Dr Seidler.She had observed MrWilonto physically discipline Tillieandknew that he had caused her bruising because she lied about it to Mr Stanhope when he observed them.There is no suggestion that MrWilonwas violent to Ms Craig nor that he ever directed Ms Craig toassaultTillie.MrWilonwas notpresentwhen Ms Craig killed Tillie.Afterkilling herdaughterMs Craig failed to summon any medical assistance. Rather,sheeitherassistedor watchedMrWilonand EMconceal hercrime. She continued toconceal it forover 35years.There are a number of aggravatingfeaturesofthe killing: Ms Craig was in a position of trustto Tillie and Tilliewasavulnerablevictim.I am careful not todouble count these factors,to the extent that they overlap.The offence was committed in the home of the victimand thedeath was caused by the use of a weapon.As for mitigating factors,it is to be accepted that the killing was not planned,althoughvery few child killings by parents are.Nor was the assault part of a pattern of behaviour by Ms Craig.Thesignificant factor relied upon by the offender to reduce the objective seriousness of this offence wasthecontextof the offending. It was submitted that Ms Craig wasa young mother who had recently exited a“tumultuous”relationship withTillie’sfather.I note that theAgreedFactsrecordthatwhen Ms Craig took Tillie away fromMr Stanhope,heslapped Ms Craig across theface.Beyond this fact,Iamunable tobe satisfied on the balance of probabilities that shewasthevictim ofongoingdomesticviolenceat that time. AlthoughMs Craigtold DrSeidlerthat her choices in partners had been poor, shedenied everhavingbeen abused in her relationships.Although the Agreed Facts disclose that MrWilontold the other residents at the retreat that Ms Craig had been a victim of domestic violence,I am not satisfied that his account can be relied upon.It wassubmitted that the objective seriousness was reduced because Ms Craig wasunder the influence of“MasterWilon”who engaged in“almost daily”violent behaviour towardsTillieandinflicted violence on other children at the property.It was accepted that it cannot be said that MrWilon’scontrolling behaviour directlycausedthe offence, butitwas submitted thatthe environment of control,violence,abuseand degradation of Ms Craig’s parental role were necessary conditions for her actions on 7 July 1987.Reliance was placed on the fact that MrWiloncontrolled the actions, words thoughts, sexual behaviours,and finances of the group through violence,fearand negative reinforcement.There was also compulsory meditation which involved“mind reading”and themanifesto reinforced notions of hierarchy in the group.A question arose during thesentencehearing as to whether the context in which the killing occurred was relevant to objective seriousness, moralculpabilityor both.Although there is a clear distinction betweentheobjective seriousness of anoffenceand the moral culpability of anoffender,some of thecircumstancesrelevant to determining moral culpability mayalsobe relevant to the determination of objective seriousness.One of those factors ismotive.[6]On behalf of the offender, it was submitted that the distinction between matters relevant to objective seriousness and moral culpability can be somewhat“blurred”and that ultimately whether this subjective material is taken intoaccount in the broad assessment of objective seriousness or whether it is compartmentalised into the idea of moral culpability did not“much matter.”[7]As I observed at the time, I am not satisfied that is the case. The recent decision inBritton v R[8]is an example of such an approach leading to error.The importance of the assessment of objective seriousness is to ensure that an adequate sentence is imposed and to ensure that the sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the crime.[9]In this way, if there is a sentencing factor potentially relevant to both objective seriousness and moral culpability, it is important that regard is had to it in the assessment of objective seriousness. That is not to say that there will not be cases where a factor could reduce both the moral culpabilityandthe objective seriousness. But that is not this case. I propose to adopt the position of the parties. I have applied the circumstancesthat the offence occurred whilst Ms Craig was briefly a member of the cult in my assessment of objective seriousness. Ihavealsohadregard to it as part of the process of instinctive synthesis when assessing Ms Craig’s subjective case.The offender’s motive was to discipline her childin the context ofanenvironmentin whichsignificant corporal punishment was normalised.It was not motivated by a desire to inflict gratuitous cruelty. Thisisrelevant to the finding of objective seriousness.The material before me establishesthatmembers ofthe cult would follow MrWilon’sorders and that hewielded complete influence.But it seems to me there is a distinction between being so brainwashed that one willingly adopts the values of the cult as opposed to simply going along withthose rulesin the absence of any other alternatives.Ms Craig toldDr Seidlerthatshe did not leavethe retreatbecause she had nowhere else togo;not because ofanydeep commitment toThe Family. Also, she described one of her personality traits as not liking being told what to do and having to compromise, which seems inconsistent with letting MrWilontell her what to do.There is no clear evidence ofthe level ofMs Craig’s commitmenttoTheFamily at the relevant timebesides what she told Dr Seidler 37 years later.Another matter relevant to how deeplyMs Craigwas influenced bythe excessive discipline she saw around heris the limited time that sheresided at the retreat. The AgreedFacts show that Ms Craig told Mr Stanhope that shewas going to live at theretreatin November 1986. She went to the retreat for a few weeks,but she left Tillie with Mr Stanhope. She collected Tillie from Mr Stanhope on 12 December 1986 and wasat the retreatuntil 26 January 1987,a period of just over six weeks, before Ms Craig took Tillie to visit Mr Stanhope. She flew to New Zealand the following day. She was then in New Zealand for six months. There is nothing to suggest she was violent to Tillie in any way during that timeand MrWilonwas not with her.It would appear that she spent time with her family during thatperiod. She moved back to Sydney on 1 July 1987. She told Dr Seidler that she did so because MrWilontold her to. She killed Tillieless than a week later.Although I accept the material before me about the rules ofThe Familyand the strict compliance by its members, Ms Craigonlyhad Tillie with her at theretreat for aboutsixweeks from late 1986until early 1987before she left its daily routinesforsixmonths. She then returned to the environment of strict discipline for onlysixdays before she killed Tillie.Another relevant matter is thatMs Craig’s assaultwent beyond anything MrWilonhadeverdone toTillie. He may have left her with bruises and scratches, as observed by Mr Stanhope, but Ms Craig told DrSeidlerthat she hit Tillieuntil she wasunresponsive.Being under the influence of MrWilonmay partiallyexplain why she assaulted Tillie when she did,butI am not satisfied it does so fully.Ihave carefully considered all of thefactors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. It has often been said that theoffence of manslaughterproducesthegreatest variety ofcircumstances affecting culpabilityofany other criminal offence. It follows that a wide range ofsentences can be imposed.[10]Although it has been said thatplacingoffendingin a manslaughter caseon some hypothetical range of manslaughters or types of manslaughters is not obligatory,[11]I consider ithelpfulto do so in this case.I have considered the aggravating and mitigating factors and the circumstances of the offending overall.Although Ms Craig assaulted Tillie as an act of discipline in the context of being a member of a“cult”and did not assault her as an act of gratuitous cruelty, this remains a seriouscase of manslaughterfor the reasons I have identified. I would assess it as being abovemid-range.Moral culpabilityIt was not suggested on behalf of Ms Craig that her moral culpability was reduced by reason of either a mental illness[12]or a deprived childhood.[13]I have already explained that it was not ultimately contended that I would reduce her moral culpability on account of her participation in the culteither.Section 21B of the Sentencing ActBefore turning to consider Ms Craig’s subjective case, it is necessary to consider whether the relevant sentencing patterns and procedures are those asat1987 or 2024.Section 21B(1) ofthe Sentencing Actprovides that a court must sentence an offender in accordance with the sentencing patterns and procedures at the time of sentencing.Section 21Bcame into effect on 18 October 2022when theCrimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Bill2022was enacted.That bill only contained one amendment to the Sentencing Act: the insertion of s 21B.The transitional provision in Schedule2 of theCrimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2022relevantlyprovides that “these amendments” to theSentencing Act do notapplyto“proceedingsthatcommencedbeforethe commencement of the amendments”, namely, 18 October 2022.The Court Attendance Notice commencing proceedings against Ms Craig was created on 8 December 2020,but she wasnotarresteduntil16 November 2021.Her first court appearance in New South Wales was inMay 2022 (following her extradition proceedings). It was not until the following year,in May 2023, thatshe wascommittedfortrialin the Supreme Court. She was arraigned for the first timeinthisCourt inAugust 2023.A factual matter arises as to when the“proceedings”against Ms Craig were commenced:wasitthe date of charge,the date of arraignment in the Supreme Courtor some other date?The High Court recently confirmedinStephens v The Queen[14]that a“trial”on indictment commences when an accused person isfirstarraigned.It has also been held that “criminal proceedings” ordinarily commence when an accused person is arrested and charged:R v Hull.[15]That decision was followed inAllerton v Director of Public Prosecutions[16]in which it was notedthatcriminal proceedingsareinstituted when the criminal justice systemisput in motion against an accused person. Itisfromwhenthe charge islaidthat aperson is subjectedto the constraints of the criminal justice system.R v HullandAllerton v Director of Public Prosecutionswere followed and applied inTJ v R[17]in the context of a transitional provision which provided that certain amendments to theCriminal Procedure Act1986(NSW)did not extend to“any proceedings commenced before the commencement of the amendments”. InTJ v R,the relevant amending Actaffecteda number of different“proceedings”from committal through totrial andsentencing. In that context,the Court of Criminal Appeal (“CCA”)rejected an argument that because the amendment the subject of argument could only apply to trials thenthe word “proceedings” should be read as “trials”. Rather, the CCA held that the proceedings commenced when the charge was laid given the variety of contexts in which the transitional provision applied.The meaning ofthe word“proceedings”in therelevanttransitional provision for s 21B was considered inRvWatson(No3).[18]Walton J appliedTJ v Rand held that“proceedings”meant when a person is arrested or charged, or an information is laid before a Magistrate. More recently, inR v Bowie[19]YehiaJrelied upon a CCA decision concerned with a differently worded transitional provision[20]which used the phrase“proceedings thehearing of whichbegan beforethecommencementoftheamendment”to construe the transitional provision for s 21B. I do not propose to follow that decisiongiven the different statutory language.I have considered these decisions. To some extent,TJ v Rturned on the fact that the relevant transitional provision under consideration applied to a number of amendments applicable to every stage of the criminal proceedings. It was on that basis that the word“proceedings”was construed to mean the date of charge. The transitional provision for s 21B is only applicable to proceedings onsentence, but neither party suggested that the“proceedings”commenced when thesentenceproceedings commenced, and I do not consider thatto bethe relevant date either.I note that inR v White, Beech Jones CJ at CL sentenced the offender for a manslaughter offence committed in 1988. Innotingthats 21B didnotapply, his Honourdid soby reference to the transitional provision. He noted that s 21Bdoes not apply to“criminal proceedings”(rather“proceedings”per se)that commenced prior to 18 October 2022.[21]I consider it worth noting that his Honourused the form“criminal proceedings,”rather than“criminal trial”as being the relevant date.For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the proceedings were commenced after s 21B was enacted. Accordingly, I am required to sentence Ms Craig in accordance with the sentencing patterns and practices at the time of the offence.Ms Craig’s subjective caseMs Craig did not give evidence. The subjective material in her casecomesalmost solelyfromwhat she toldDrSeidler. Although that material was not challenged, it is worth noting thatmost of it has not been confirmed by other evidence.Ms Craig is 62 years old.She was born in New Zealand as the youngest of five children.Shereportedbeing raised in a stable and supportive family environmentwithher parents no longer alive.She described that even though there was some tension in her parents’relationship, they never separated. There was no family violence and there was absence of violence or corporal punishmentasdiscipline.She described her mother as“just beautiful”and the“most loving kind”and“non-judgmental”person. Despiteat one stagedescribing her father asselfishandcantankerous,she said she had“great”relationshipwithhimand looked up tohim.Ms Craigdisclosedan incident when she was12 years oldandone of her brothers,who wasintoxicatedat the time, got into bed with her andrubbedhimself against her“trying to get into (her) pants”. The incident had a“huge impact on her”.She reported the onset of interpersonal difficulties while she was at school.She“hated”school,did not like authority, was resistant to structure and had few friends.She left school when she was legally able to.She obtained her first job when she was about 15 years old in a café and also worked in a sauna house, at a service station and in waitressing.She left homefor the first time when she was around 15 years of age and was back and forth withherfamily until she leftforAustralia when she was 21 years oldtopursuea relationship.In Australia,Ms Craigapparentlytrained and worked as ayouthworker.Shehada number of relationshipsincluding the one with Mr Stanhope that resulted in the birth of Tillie.She describedherrelationships as all beingshort lived and dysfunctional.She suggested that relationships do not work for her because she does not like“being considerate”of others or having to take“otherscircumstances into consideration”. She also does not like being“told what to do”.Following Tillie’s death,she returned to New Zealandwhere she worked as a community development advisor, a coordinator for crime prevention and a coordinator at a women’s refuge. Her job at the women’s refuge was terminatedbecause she stolefrom her employer.She has not worked since 2009 due to her poor mental healthand drug addiction.Ms Craig did not go on to have other children. She hasbeen singlesince2007.Good characterAt the time of the offending,Ms Craig was a personwithouta criminal recordand stands to be sentenced as a person of prior good character.She was subsequently convicted of fraud inNew Zealand in 2009in relation to stealing from her employerto fund her drug and gambling problems. She wassentenced to 100 hours of community work.Drug and alcohol historyMs Craig reported being exposed to alcohol and illicit drugs in her adolescenceandhasstruggledwith both substance abuse andgamblingthroughout her life.Shefound themto be effective in dealing with emotion avoidance and coping with life.She has incurred serious debt through gambling. She initially used her mother’s money to pay for this before resorting to fraud.Shereported first using amphetamines at around the age of 21 years old and though she stopped for a while, usedthembetween 1995 and 1998.In 2000, Ms Craig was introduced to crystal methamphetamine and reported that she developed a“really bad”dependence on the drug. She told DrSeidler that she maintained a habitual pattern of smoking crystal methamphetamine(“ice”)up until her arrest although her use varied in quantity. She found the drug to be“fun”.Mental healthI have had regard to thetworeportsprepared byDr Katie Seidler.Ms Craig reportedto Dr Seidler thatshe has always sufferedfromfeelings of anxiety,andshemay have suffered from depressed mood in a cyclical manner over the years.Shereported that she considered ending her life when she was caught for fraud offending however did not act on italthoughshedidcut her wrists when the suppression order was lifted over her name. She also reported suffering from a“breakdown”in 2007 that was triggered by a dysfunctional relationship that she was in.In 2023, Dr Seidlerundertook apsychometric assessment to assessMs Craig’smental health and personality functioning. She usedthe Personality Assessment Inventory (“PAI”).Ms Craig was assessed byDr Seidleraslikely suffering fromSchizoidPersonalityDisorderand experiencing transient depressive symptomology. Her PAI profile was also suggestive of someone who is not motivated for psychological treatment.Dr Seidler’s subsequent assessment of Ms Craigfollowingherplea to manslaughterreinforced her earlier opinion that she likely suffersfromSchizoidPersonalityDisorder, due to her attraction to mystical and spiritual beliefs and her detached and emotionless experience of trauma in the aftermath of the death ofTillie.Shealso noted that Ms Craig hashada number ofmental health difficulties over the yearsincludingperiods of anxiety, depressive statesandepisodesofpanic. Her primary coping mechanism is avoidance, which hascontributed to her alcohol and drug abuse over the years.Physical healthMs Craig has been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”). She has also sustained a serious wrist injury in custody.She has had some of her teeth removed because she did not look after them properly andsheuses dentures. She was diagnosed withRheumatoidArthritis in 2001 but she claimsthat is manageable.I have considered the material relied upon by Ms Craigabout her COPD in particular. Although it is a condition that can be treated in custody, it makes her very vulnerable due to the risks ofcatchingany respiratoryconditionincluding a cold,influenzaorCOVID-19. I am satisfied that she will suffer moreonerousconditionsin custody as a result of having COPD.RemorseMs Craig expressedsomeremorseto Dr Seidler whose opinion was that“Tillie’s death and her involvement init, were traumatic forher”.She opined thatMs Craig now accepts responsibility for her actions and describedseemingly genuine,realisticand appropriate remorse and contrition for her behaviour.MsCraig also told Dr Seidler thatshe did not come forward earlier for fear of losing family support and she didnotwant to face the psychological consequences.Ms Craigalsoprovided a letter to the court dated5 August 2024expressing remorse.This letter was not read out in court,so I consider it important to readportionsof it out now.Relevant to the offending,Ms Craigstated:“Something happened to me as a mother when I was at Porters Retreat. I lost focus and I was sidetracked. I felt a sense of detachment from Tillie. I cannot explain it beyond this. I can remember hearing Wilon hit her in the bathroom and hearing her cry and not feeling the distress that I know I should have felt. I feel ashamed about that. I am ashamed that I didn’t do anything to stop it.I have thought about her dying and the horror of that day for her. My actions were horrible, terrible, horrific.I have thought about Wilon putting Tillie’s body in that 44 gallon drum. I can remember not being able to speak. It was horrific. He put her in there because of my actions.My thoughts have been around who she could have been as a person. I took away her potential. I took away her right to a happylife. She would have been 40 this year. I can only picture her as a baby and a two year oId but that is because of me and what I did.When I was first arrested, nothing seemed real, until I heard a judge in New Zealandsay‘the matter of Craig…beating her daughter to death’. At that point, the enormity of what I was facing hit me and I wanted to die. Still, it was all about me: what I was going through, what consequences I was facing. I cut my wrists. I lied to my lawyers because I wanted to avoid dealing with it. I maintained this lie for a long time.I have spent a lot of time thinking about Tillie and what I have done while I have been in gaol and my perspective has changed. I want justice for Tillie through this process. That is frightening to me but I now understand and I am at peace with the purpose of my imprisonment. It is fair to say that I am frightened but also happy that justice is being done. It is not about me, except for the consequences that I deserve to face. Otherwise, it is all about Tillie.”Ms Craig went onin the letterto apologise to Tilliefor the bad decisions she made includingdeferringherparenting responsibilities toMrWilon.She stated,“I will never forgive myself for what I have done. All I can try to do is live with it and atone for it however I can”.Ms Craig then went on to apologise to Mr Stanhope in these terms:“I know that Gerard loved Tillie. Tillie loved Gerard, so much. I am sorry for taking her away and for what I put him through. I feel real shame for the way I acted towards him after Tillie died.I recognise that I took away his right to mourn Tillie and for him to know the truth.I am sorry that I did not tell him the truth.I am sorry that he went looking for her and met so many dead ends. It musthave been terrible for him to be looking for her with so much hope when she was already gone.I was frightened of Gerard and the consequences of him finding out for me. Still, I recognise that Gerard never gave up. I have had to time to think of his despair and anxiety that must have been caused by not knowing what happened to Tillie. I am sorry that I caused all of that. It was in my power to alleviate it and I never did it.I respect and understand his right to remain angry with me and never to forgive me. I also want to say sorry to Gerard’s family for what I did.”Ms Craig then thanked andacknowledgedEM for the courage she had in going to the policeand apologised to her own family including for lying to them for so long.The Crown submitted thatMs Craig’s expressions of remorse are very recent, after decades of lies.Further, the lies continuedlong after she returned to New Zealand and was no longer under the influence of MrWilon.Despite the fact that she did not give evidence,I am satisfied that Ms Craig isnowgenuinely remorseful. It isregrettable that thisremorsecameso late. Mr Stanhope and other family members spent many years not knowing where TilliewaswhenMs Craig had the power to put them out of their miserybutdid not.Therationalefor takinggenuine remorseinto account as a mitigating factor is that it is indicative of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of further offending.[22]It is difficult to see what other relevance it has tothe sentencingprocess.[23]Thus, despite the fact that the genuine remorse is late, I have taken itinto account to find that she is unlikely to offend further.Prospects for rehabilitation/Risk of re-offendingMs Craig has not led a blameworthy life sincethe commission of this offence. In addition to being convicted of fraud, she has had gambling andillicitdrugaddictions. Her usage of ice and the fact that she has not workedsince 2009 areanti-social factors.Despite this, I am willing to accept thatMs Craighasreasonableprospects of rehabilitation giventhe lack of any further offences of violence,her age, and her remorse and insight.Her age upon release will be another factor militating against further criminal activity.Conditions ofcustodyMs Craig submitted that she has been housed in the SMAPdue to the nature of her crime. She has contracted COVID multiple times since beingincarcerated and also sustained a serious wrist injury.She told Dr Seidler that she feels safe in the gaol now afterbeing placed on protection.She is employed as a sweeper in the reception areaanddescribed to Dr Seidler that she was“really happy and content”to be busyand she enjoysthe“simple life”of prisons. She has always been attracted to a“monastic”lifestyle and she believes that gaol provides this for her in a way. Despite this,relationshipswith other inmates can be stressful.I have already found that Ms Craig’s conditions in custody will be more onerous due to her COPD. I propose to take her conditions in custody into account when considering the statutory ratio.[24]DelayThere has been a delay of 37yearsbetween the commission of the offenceandsentence.There area number ofbases upon whichdelay canbe taken into account when sentencing an offenderincludingthe uncertain suspensethe offender may have been left in, anydemonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening periodand the fact thatsentencingfor a“stale crime”callsfor“a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach”.[25]There is nothing in the material relied upon by theoffender to suggest that she has lived ina state of uncertain suspensesince killing her daughter.As for herrehabilitation,she has not committed any subsequent offences of violence, only fraud.I have already considered that factor when assessing her prospects of re-offending and rehabilitation.I am satisfied thatthe onlyreal significanceof delay is that I amrequiredto apply sentencing principlesand practicesfrom the late1980s when sentencing Ms Craig, to the extent that they can be gleaned.Historical sentencing patternsThe offenderrelied uponJudicial Commissionpublications[26]which provided the range of sentencesformanslaughterover different time periods. It was submitted that sentences became more severe between 1993 and 2001and thatheadsentences for manslaughterinvolving the death ofchildreninthatperiodranged from 2 years to16 years imprisonmentand non-parole periodsrangedfrom8 months to 11 years imprisonment.The offender relied upon the decision inR v Monroe[27]in which it was noted that asat2003 the“range”ofterms of imprisonmentfor the manslaughter of young children by persons in position of trust and protection was between5and6years at the lower end and10years towards the higher end.The difficulty withidentifying a“range”of past sentencesis, as Simpson J observed inDe La Rosa,[28]that theupper range of sentences is the maximum penalty, not the highest sentence imposed in the past. If an offence is objectively more serious than the highest recorded sentence in that time period a higher sentence up to the maximum penalty can be imposed.Aswas observed inR v White[29]to some extent, itis a difficult task to establish that there has been an adverse change insentencing practices formanslaughteroffencescommitted before 12 January 1990given thatthe maximum penaltywasactuallyreducedon that date.Further, as the casesI haveconsideredmake clear, it is difficult to identify a case with similar objective and subjectivefactorsto the present in any event.Although I am prepared to accept thatin general terms,the median sentence for manslaughter wasmost likelylower in the1980s, itdoes not follow that significant sentences were notimposedin appropriate casesduring that period.ComparablecasesThe Crown identified nine cases said to be comparable and the offender relied on the schedule of cases from the Public Defenders website on the killing of children by parents.What is striking is that there are no cases remotely similar to this case factually.In many of the cases put before me the death of the child was likely occasioned by shaking in the context of drug or alcohol use, or a short burst of anger by the offender.[30]Other cases concern parental neglect or negligence in not seeking attention for the child[31]orthe offender was not aware that the acts causing death were dangerous.[32]Inothercasesthe parent suffered from a cognitive impairment[33]or wassuffering from post-natal depression.[34]In onecase,the parents suffered from fanatical beliefs,[35]although that was a very different case tothis one.Even the three cases which seemedthe most similar are markedly different.R v Byrne[2001] NSWSC 1164Both partiesrelied on this case as beingcomparable. In that case, theoffender was the child’s mother. The childvictim died as a result of hypothermia following a sustained beating with a wooden spoon and being left in a cold bathroom in the middle of winter. Upon realising the gravity of the child’s injuries,the offender refrained from taking him to the hospital for fear of the consequences she would face, instead submerging him in an overheated bath which occasioned further injury in the form of burns. The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Shetold thecourt that she had been subjectedto domestic violence and molested as a child. A psychiatrist diagnosed her with a mild socialphobia and a number of personality disorders. She was also assessed by a clinical psychologist as having a very low IQ, in the borderline intellectual functioning range. After a 15% discount for her plea, Ms Byrne received asentenceof imprisonment of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years.The starting point was 10 years. Thatsentence was imposed23 years ago.The offenderinBrynehad a stronger subjective case and the offending was of a different nature.RvHoerler[2004] NSWCCA 184; (2004) 147 A Crim R 520This was a Crown appealagainst a sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months. The offenderin that case wastheboyfriendof the child’s mother.Heoccasioned severe injuries to the deceased, a seven-month-old baby, including pushing the lower teeth into the roof of the mouth (which must have involvedconsiderable force delivered by a punch), rib fractures, a head injury, and facial injuries consistent with the body being dragged facedown over a surface such as a carpet or a sofa. The deceased died after inhaling his own vomit. This case involved substantial gratuitous cruelty. The offender showed no remorse and there were no mitigating subjective factors. The offender sought at the proceedings on sentence to deflect his own responsibility. The court allowed theCrownappeal and resentenced the offender to 14 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 9 months.That sentence was imposed20 years ago.Both the objective and subjective factors were very different in thiscase,but it demonstrates the type of matter where higher sentenceshave beenimposedfor manslaughter involving the death of a child by a caregiver.R v DF[2022] NSWSC 762The Crownrelied upon this more recent case. The offender was the child’smother. Sheviolently assaulted her child withherhands or fists, causing significant blunt force injuriesand thendelayed seeking medical advice despitebeing advised to do so byfamily members. The sentencing Judge found her experience of custody was likely to be more onerous than the average inmate given her depression, the COVID-19 pandemic and treatment by other inmates. He found the offence to fall well above the mid-range.The offenderhad no significant criminal record but displayed no remorse. After a 5% discount for her plea,the offender received a sentence of 14 years and 3 months and a non-parole period of 10 years and 8 months.The starting point was15 years imprisonment.The offender submitted thatDFdiffers from the present case on the basisofthesignificantinternal injuriesin that matter and that the assault occurredin the presence of a younger child.I accept that to be the case.I have examined all of these decisions and they confirm the broad range of casescovered by the offence of manslaughter, even when confined to parents killing children.I alsoviewedthem in the context that none of them weresentenced in thelate 1980s. Neither party was able to identify anyrelevantcases from that period. Ihave relied on the principlesderivedfromthese latercases.Special circumstancesCounsel forMs Craigsubmitted that a“generous”finding of special circumstances would be appropriate in Ms Craig’s case ona number ofbases:that this is her first time in custody;historical approaches to the setting of non-parole period citingWhite,[36]her ongoing chronic health issuesthat significantly elevate her health risk due to COVID-19in theconfined custodial setting;and her SMAP custodial status that restricts her access to programs and education and limits association with other inmates.The Crown submitted that I would not find special circumstances on the basis that the statutory non-parole period would provide sufficient time for Ms Craig’s supervision in the community.I am satisfied that I should make a finding of“special circumstances”for the reasons advanced but in particularto reflect thehistoricalpractice whereby asat5 July 1987 the non-parole period wasusually fixed atapproximately two-thirds of the total sentence.[37]In that regard,Ms Craig has benefited from the fact that s 21B does not apply to these sentence proceedings.I note that thefact of possible or pending deportation isnota relevant factor in sentencing in New South Wales[38]and I must put the fact that Ms Craig will most likely be deported to New Zealand upon her release at theexpirationof her non-parole period to one side.The purposes of sentencingThe purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Act are:(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,(c)to protect the community from the offender,(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender,(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and thecommunity.In each sentencing exercise some of these purposes will be more significant than others.The Crown submitted that the purposes of punishment and accountability loomed large in this matter. The purpose of general deterrence was also said to be important because the communityexpectsparents not toharm their children. Aswasobserved inHoerler,[39]“the sense of outrage in the community about such a case is so strong that the element of retribution must play a prominent part in theexerciseof the sentencing discretion”.It was submitted on behalf of Ms Craig that the utility ofbothgeneraldeterrenceand specific deterrencein her case is reduced by virtue of the unusual circumstances that resulted in Tillie’s deathand that it is highly unlikely thatMs Craigwould offend again.I accept this submissioninsofar as it concernsspecificdeterrence,butI am satisfied thatgeneral deterrenceremainsimportantin this case.I am satisfied that the sentence I impose must reflect the importantsentencingpurposes ofpunishment,accountabilityand denunciation and torecognise the harm done to the community.Commencement dateThe offender was arrested in New Zealand on 16 November 2021 and has been in custody, bail refused, since this date.There is no dispute thatI should start the sentence from this date.OrdersEllen Craig, but for your plea of guilty I would have imposed a sentence of12yearsimprisonment. Having regard to your early plea of guilty and applying a 25% discount to that sentence, the sentence I impose is reduced accordingly.For the offence of manslaughter,Ellen CraigI convict you and sentence you to:Imprisonment for a term of9 yearsto commence on 16 November 2021 and expire on15November 2030.The non-parole period is6yearsto commence on 16 November 2021 andexpire on15November 2027.Youwill be eligible for parole on15November 2027.Pursuant tos 25C of theCrimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006(NSW),you areadvised of the existence of that Act and of its application to the offence of whichyou havebeen convicted.Yourlegal representatives are requested to adviseyouof the implications of that Act toyou.*******Endnotes1.Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) s 25D(3)(b).2.Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 at [51].3.The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54 at [27] (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ).4.Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [64] (per French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ).5.R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported).6.Tepania v R [2018] NSWCCA 247; (2018) 275 A Crim R 233 at [12]; DS v R; DM v R (2022) 109 NSWLR 82; [2022] NSWCCA 156; Britton v R [2024] NSWCCA 138.7.Tcpt, 12 August 2024, p 20.8.[2024] NSWCCA 138.9.R v Van Ryn [2016] NSWCCA 1 at [134]-[135].10.R v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67; [2005] HCA 37 at [22] (per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ).11.Paterson v R [2021] NSWCCA 273 at [33].12.Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194.13.Bugmy v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 571; [2013] HCA 37.14.[2022] HCA 31.15.(1989) 16 NSWLR 385 at 390 (per Gleeson CJ, Grove and Studdert JJ agreeing).16.(1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 558.17.(2009) 76 NSWLR 167; [2009] NSWCCA 257.18.[2022] NSWSC 1693.19.[2023] NSWSC 207.20.Bektasovski v R [2022] NSWCA 246 at [51].21.R v White [2023] NSWSC 611 at [76].22.Stojanovski v R [2013] NSWCCA 334 at [41] (per Simpson J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing).23.Brzozowski v R [2023] NSWCCA 129 at [3] (per Simpson AJA, Rothman and Cavanagh JJ agreeing).24.Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) s 44(2).25.R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 at [16].26.Extract from Research Monograph of the Judicial Commission, Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1990-1993, A Legal and Sociological Study; Extract from Research Monograph of the Judicial Commission, Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2001.27.[2003] NSWSC 1271; 148 A Crim R 478 at [73].28.Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [304].29.[2023] NSWSC 611.30.R v Wilson [2003] NSWSC 1257; R v GJL [2009] NSWDC 167; R v Mundene [2007] NSWSC 355; R v Monroe [2003] NSWSC 1271; (2003) 149 A Crim R 478.31.R v O’Brien [2003] NSWCCA 121; R v HA [2008] NSWSC 1368; R v Thomas Sam; R v Manju Sam (No. 18) [2009] NSWSC 1003.32.R v Shepherd [2010] NSWSC 154.33.R v Bilton [2000] NSWSC 1113; R v Byrne [2001] NSWSC 1164; R v HA [2008] NSWSC 1368.34.R v NLH [2010] NSWSC 662.35.R v Mika; R v Sagato [2000] NSWSC 852; (2000) 116 A Crim R 31.36.R v White [2023] NSWSC 611 at [74]-[76].37.Ibid at [78].38.Afful v R [2021] NSWCCA 111 at [51].39.At [42].Amendments18 September 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tcoversheet correctionDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Ms Dabboussi’sunchallengedevidence includes the following.On 11 January 2022, Ms Dabboussi entered into a contract to purchase a property in Rossmore, for $2,090,000. She paid a deposit of $209,000 but required finance to meet the balance of the purchase price.In April 2022, Ms Dabboussi and her husband engaged in correspondence with the defendant, whom Ms Dabboussi understood could assist procuring finance.On 27 April and 30 May 2022, the defendant issued invoices to Ms Dabboussi totalling $8,250, said to represent due diligence and valuation fees. Theseinvoices were paid by CoreAssist.On 17 June 2022, the defendant sent an email toMs Dabboussi,stating:HiGhina,Yourloan has been conditionally approved, please review and sign the attached mandate. Once signed we will send you the final loan document.The 17 June 2022 email included a link to a document titled“Mandate, Brokerage Agreement and Irrevocable Authority to Pay on First Drawdown or Settlement”. Ms Dabboussi signed this document on behalf of CoreAssist, as the borrower, and personally, as guarantorof CoreAssist.Ms Dabboussi did not receive the“final loan document”referred to in the 17 June 2022 correspondence. In evidence is a document dated 21 June 2022, entitled“Formal Letter of OfferForMortgage Loan”, which bears a“VOID”watermark on every page. Ms Dabboussi’s evidence is that she did notbecomeaware of the existence of this letter until 16 January 2023, when it was sent to her by a representative of the defendant.Between 24 and 27 June 2022, Ms Dabboussi’s husband unsuccessfully attempted to contact the defendant. The plaintiffs thereafter formed the belief that the defendantwasnot able or willing to obtain financing.On 13 July 2022, the plaintiffs engaged a different financial broker who, by 10 August 2022, had successfully secured financing for the plaintiffs. The contract for sale eventually completed on 19 August 2022.Onaround7 November 2022, Ms Dabboussi received a Notice of Caveat from NSW Land Registry Services, notifying her that the defendant had lodged a caveat against the Bass Hill Property.The defendant’s interest was described in the caveat in the following terms:Caveator has a caveatable interest pursuant to Mandate, brokerage agreement and irrevocable authority dated 16/06/2022On21 December 2022,Ms Dabboussiwas contacted bya representative of the defendant, who explained that his firm had been instructed“to recover a debt owed by Core Assist Pty Ltd with respect to the…Mandate Agreement”.On 16 January 2023, the same representative sent email correspondence to the plaintiffs’solicitor, attaching a tax invoice claiming $104,500 (comprising a $50,000 mandate fee, $18,000 interest fee and $27,000in legal fees and additional costs). Also attached wasacopy of the letter of offer dated 23 June 2022, marked“VOID”. Ms Dabboussi’s evidence is that the plaintiffs had not known of, nor received, this tax invoice prior to the email.On 11 April 2023, the plaintiffs’solicitor lodged a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority(AFCA), who subsequently issued a recommendation andthendetermination. The AFCA determination included:If the complainants both accept this determination within 30 days of it being issued, then within a further 30 days of being notified of the complainants’ acceptance of this determination, the broker must:…- remove the caveat registered over [Ms Dabboussi’s] property- waive the outstanding invoices for the costs it claims the complainants are liable to pay under the mandate agreement and notify the complainants of that waiver accordingly.On 3 November 2023, AFCA sent a letter to the plaintiffs’solicitor confirming that the plaintiffs had accepted the AFCA determination and explaining that the defendant had been notified of this fact.Filed in support of thepresentmotion are the affidavits of Hani Skaf, solicitor for the plaintiffs, sworn 19, 29 and 31 July and 9 August 2024. Mr Skaf’s evidenceincludes the following:Between 15 April 2024 and 6 June 2024, Mr Skaf inquired with the defendant’s solicitorson four occasions whetherthedefendant intended to file a defence.The responses to this correspondence included attachinga draft defence andindicatinganintention to file a cross-claim. However, no such documents were ever filed.On 12 June 2024, Mr Skaf obtained“Grantor Search Certificates”from thePersonal Property Securities Register(PPSR). These certificatesdemonstratethat no security interestshave beenregistered on the PPSRasagainst Ms Dabboussi, but thatasecurity interest for all present and after-acquiredproperty has been registered in favour of the defendantagainst CoreAssist.Principles and determinationUnder r 16.10 UCPR, the Courtmayenter default judgment in proceedings,commenced by statement of claim,where the relief sought is other than thatspecified inrr16.4-16.8 UCPR.Where default judgment is sought under r 16.10 UCPR,the Court retainsadiscretion as to whether or not to enter judgment:Dandaloo Pty Ltd vIali[2017] NSWSC 1738 at [38],citingTermijtelenv VanArkel[1974] 1 NSWLR 525 at 529-531 and 534-535.Part 16 UCPR, including r 16.10, does not strictly apply to these proceedings, since they were commenced by summons, not statement of claim: r 16.1 UCPR.However, I accept that“Part 16 of the UCPR may be applied by analogy to proceedings commenced by summons…through orders made under s 61(3) of the Civil Procedure Act”:In the matter of Bleecker Property Group Pty Ltd (InLiquidation)[2023] NSWSC 1071at [12] (Williams J),citingProperty Investors Alliance Pty Ltd v C88 Project Pty Ltd[2021] NSWSC 1175 at [14] (Hammerschlag J, as his Honour then was).Here, the defendant has failed to comply with the Court’s orders of 3 April 2024, requiring it to file evidence in response by12April2024. In so failing, and by analogy with r 16.2 UCPR, I consider the defendant is“in default”for the purposes of entering default judgment under s 61(3)Civil Procedure Act. By analogy with r 16.10UCPR, however, I do not consider it follows as a matter of course that default judgment should be entered. The Court retains adiscretion andmust be satisfied the plaintiffs appear entitled to the reliefthey seek.I am satisfied on the evidencebefore the Court thatdefault judgment should be entered in respect of the plaintiffs’claim for the removal of the defendant’s caveat under s 74MAReal Property Act.The relevant questions for the Court in determining whether a caveat should be removed under s 74MA were stated by Ball J at [8] inAbraham v Abraham[2012] NSWSC 254:[T]he question is whether an interlocutory injunction would be granted to protect the interest claimed in the caveat. That, in turn, raises two questions. The first is whether there is a serious question to be tried concerning the interest claimed in the property that is sought to be protected. The second is whether the balance of convenience is in favour of maintaining the caveat…Here, it is of primary significance that AFCA has made a determination, which the plaintiffs have accepted, requiring the defendant to remove the caveat over the Bass Hill Property. InAustralia Capital Financial Management Pty Ltd v Australian Financial Complaints Authority Ltd[2022] NSWCA 204at [7], Bell CJ and Meagher JA explained the effect of AFCA determinationsas follows:Once a complaint is made to AFCA, its Rules form a contract between the complainant,AFCAand the Financial Firm. AFCA’s determination of the complaint is “final”, and binding on both parties if accepted by the complainant within 30 days of receipt (r A.15.3).It is clear that AFCA’s determination is binding on the defendant. In circumstances where the defendant istherefore alreadyobliged to remove the caveat, I amsatisfied thatthere isnoserious question to be tried concerningthe interest claimed in the property that is sought to be protectedby the caveat. As such, the caveat should be removed.However,I am not satisfied that default judgment should be entered in respect of the plaintiffs’claim for the removal security interests registered by the defendant under the PPSA. No power of the Court has been identified by the plaintiffs pursuant to which this relief is sought.The relevant power would appear to be located in s 182Personal Property Securities Act2009 (Cth),the relevant parts ofwhichreadas follows:(4) On an application under this section, a court may make the following orders:(a) if the court considers the amendment demanded to be authorised under section 178 — an order requiring the Registrar to register a financing change statement amending the registration (including an amendment to remove the registration);…(c) any other order that the court thinks fit.The power of the Court identified in s 182 isclearlypremised on an“amendmentdemand”having been issued: s 178Personal Property Securities Act. In circumstances where there is no evidence that an amendment demand has been issued, I am not satisfiedthe plaintiffs are entitled to relief under s 182. Default judgmentwillthereforenot beentered in respect of this prayer for relief.I also do not consider that it is appropriate to make the declaration sought by the plaintiffs,that they are“not liable to the defendant on the mandate, brokerage agreement dated 15 June 2022”.Courts are reticent to grant declaratory relief on applications for default or summary judgment: QBE Insurance (Aust) Ltd v Thornton[2012] NSWSC 217at [16] (Ball J), citingGPI Leisure Corporation Ltd (in liq) v Yuill[1997] NSWSC 292.Additionally, as the High Court explained inAinsworth v Criminal Justice Commission(1992) 175 CLR 562 at 582,courtsshould not grant declarations where theywould“produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties”(Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey andGaudronJJ): see alsoCIMIC Group Limited v AIG Group Limited[2022] NSWSC 999at [624]-[634] (Peden J).Here, the plaintiffs already haveabinding AFCA determination, which findsthat“there are no monies owing to”the defendant under thebrokerageagreementandrequiresthe defendant to“waive the outstanding invoices for the costs it claims [the plaintiffs] are liable to pay under”that agreement.In these circumstances, I do not consider that there is any utility in making the declaration sought.Conclusion and ordersIn light of the above, it is not necessary to consider the alternative claim for summary judgment under r 13.1 UCPR, save to note that, for the reasons given in respect of default judgment, I do not consider that summary judgmentshouldbe entered in respect of theprayers forPPSR anddeclaratory relief.The appropriate orders are:Judgment for the plaintiffs pursuant tos 61(3)Civil Procedure Act2005 (NSW).Order that pursuant to s 74MA of theReal Property Act1900 (NSW), the caveat dealing AS596060 in relation to Lot 12 in DP 872771 with folio identifier 12/872771 be withdrawn by 5pm on 28 August 2024.Amended summons and amended notice of motion otherwise dismissed.Defendanttopay the plaintiffs’costs as agreed or assessed.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Thesecond defendant, the Officer in Charge of the investigation,was represented by a solicitor,Mr Deards,who argued thatnone of the groundsof appealwere made out andthatthe matters complained of,takencumulatively,did not establish a case for apprehended bias.Due to the nature of the arguments, it is necessary to reproduce in full a number of the exchanges that occurred in the Local Court.Having listened to all of the audio,andhavingcarefully consideredthe oral and writtensubmissionsmade byMr Howellof counselon behalf of Ms Heywood,andofMr Deards,I have come to the view, reluctantly,for the reasons that follow,that the relief sought in the summons should be grantedand that all three grounds for judicial review have been established.Pursuant to s 69 of theSupreme Court Act, anorder in the nature of prohibition will be made,precluding the Magistrate from hearing the proceedings:Police v Heywood.The matter will now have to recommence before a different Magistrate.The partiesand background to the proceedings in the Armidale Local CourtOn 8 March 2022, a public event was held at the Armidale Ex Services Memorial Club to mark International Women’s Day. The event was attended by members of the Armidale community,including students from several local highschools.Ms Heywoodwas one of three guest speakers at the event.At the time she was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England.It is alleged that as attendees mingled following the conclusion of the event’s formalities,Ms Heywoodlicked her index finger and wiped it on a schoolgirl’s face,making an offensive and racist comment as she did so.On 1 August 2022,Ms Heywoodwas charged with offences contrary to s 61 of theCrimes Act 1900(NSW), of common assault; and s 4(1) of theSummary Offences Act 1988(NSW), of behaving in an offensive manner in a public place.She entered pleas of not guilty on 26 September 2022.Principles-apprehended biasAs stated by Bell CJ inState of New South Wales v Madden[2024] NSWCA 40 at [100]:“InEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy(2000) 205 CLR 337; [2000] HCA 63 at [6], the High Court stated that an apprehension of judicial bias arises where (see alsoCharisteas v Charisteas(2021) 273 CLR 289; [2021] HCA 29 at [11]):“…a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide”.”I have taken into account the followingpropositionscollected by Bell P (as the Chief Justice then was) inPolsen v Harrison[2021] NSWCA 23that emerged from decisions of the High Court and various Courtsof Appeal:“[44]The first stage of the two stageEbnertest requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits whilst the second requires an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits.…[46]To the passages from the authorities extracted and emphasised by the trial judge (see [23]-[24] above) may be added the following propositions:(i)the application of the apprehended bias rule depends on the circumstances of each case;[1](ii)the fair-minded lay observer is an hypothetical figure, founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary;[2](iii)there is an unavoidable level of imprecision in the standard of what a fair-minded lay observer “might” apprehend, such that a fanciful or speculative possibility must be clearly distinguished from the requisite “firmly-established” apprehension of bias;[3](iv)a finding of apprehended bias is not to be reached lightly;[4](v)this is because the training, tradition and oath or affirmation of a professional judge require him or her to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial;[5](vi)the duty of a judge to disqualify for proper reasons is matched by an equally significant duty to hear any case in which there is no proper reason to disqualify;[6](vii)the fair-minded lay observer is presumed to approach the matter on the basis that ordinarily the judge will act so as to ensure both the appearance and the substance of impartiality,such that[7](viii)the rebuttal of this presumption requires a “realistic possibility” of the apprehension of bias which is not “fanciful or extravagant” but is based on “the established facts” of the matter;[8](ix)“neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious”, the fair-minded lay observer may have a level of scepticism as to professional pretensions, but will be cognisant of and vigilant against his or her own prejudices;[9](x)the inquiry as to whether a judge might reasonably be apprehended to deviate from bringing an impartial mind to the resolution of a particular issue “requires no prediction about how the judge … will in fact approach the matter” and “admits of the possibility of human frailty”;[10](xi)the fair-minded lay observer is not presumed to reject the possibility of pre-judgment of a matter, otherwise an apprehension of bias would never arise in the case of a professional judge; however,[11](xii)interventionist comments or conduct by a judge will not unilaterally create an apprehension of bias in the mind of the reasonable lay observer, who is taken to understand that such interventions are often motivated by the judge’s desire to understand the evidence and to advance the trial process;[12](xiii)it is “difficult, and probably impossible, to state in the abstract, in a manner suitable for application to cases generally, the degree of knowledge to be attributed to a fair-minded observer”;[13](xiv)there is to be attributed to the fair-minded observer a broad knowledge of the material objective facts as ascertained by the appellate court and the “actual circumstances of the case”as though the observer was sitting in the court;[14](xv)the fair-minded lay observer is taken to know the nature of the decision, the circumstances which led to the decision and the context in which it was made;[15](xvi)the context which must be considered includes the legal, statutory and factual context in which the decision is made,and “the totality of the circumstances”,although the fair minded lay observer will not be taken to have a detailed knowledge of the law or legal principles;[16](xvii)the knowledge that the fair minded observer is taken to have is not limited to those facts and matters that were known at the time of an application for recusal and includes published statements made by the judge (whether prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent to the recusal application);[17](xvii)the fair-minded lay observer will not act on “insufficient knowledge”, but will “inform himself [or herself]” of the relevant circumstances, without making “snap judgments”;[18](xix)the judge’s own view about his or her ability to decide the case independently and impartially, as recorded in any reasons fordismissing a recusal application, carries little weight in the fair mind of the hypothetical lay observer, although[19](xx)statements in a recusal judgment regarding factual matters, including the particular context of the comments or conduct in question, may be relevant;[20](xxi)the fair-minded lay observer would not reasonably apprehend bias on the part of a judge from a short and emotional exchange taken out of context and weighed in isolation;[21](xxii)the fair-minded lay observer will have regard to the cumulative effect of comments made by a judge and not to particular individual statements removed from their context;and[22](xxiii)subsequent statements made by a judge, following the comments or conduct said to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, may indicate that an earlier expressed statement or impression was not final or that the judge had not committed to a particular point of view.”[23](Footnotes renumbered for this judgment).In 2023,the High CourtinQYFM v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs(2023) 97 ALJR 419;[2023] HCA 15 at [37]to[38]per Kiefel CJ and Gageler Jandper Gordon J at[67]to[73]further consideredin practical termswhat was required by the test inEbnerv Official Trustee in Bankruptcy(2000) 205 CLR 337; [2000] HCA 63:“[37] The criterion for the determination of an apprehension of bias on the part of a judge was definitively stated inEbnerby reference to previous authority and has often been repeated. The criterion is whether \"a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide\". The \"double might\" serves to emphasise that the criterion is concerned with \"possibility (real and not remote), not probability\".[38] Application of the criterion was identified inEbner, and has been reiterated, logically to entail: (1) identification of the factor which it is said might lead a judge to resolve the question other than on its legal and factual merits; (2) articulation of the logical connection between that factor and the apprehended deviation from deciding that question on its merits; and (3) assessment of the reasonableness of that apprehension from the perspective of a fair-minded lay observer.…[67] As this Court held inEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, a judge is disqualified, subject to qualifications relating to waiver or necessity, \"if a fair‑minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide\". TheEbnertest has two steps: first, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits; and second, there must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. Once those two steps are taken, the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias can then ultimately be assessed.[68] Four aspects of the test are critical to observe. First, it is an objective test: it does not require a conclusion about the judge'sactualstate of mind or an assertion ofactualbias. The principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done.[69] Second, it is a test of possibility, not probability - whether the fair-minded lay observer might reasonably think that the judgemightbe biased. It has even been said that the fair-minded lay observer is generally taken to be mistaken because decision-makers will rarely be biased in the ways attributed to them, as the observer might have appreciated if fully apprised of the operation of a particular decision maker. That said, a finding of apprehended bias is \"not to be reached lightly\". In determining whether an apprehension of bias arises, relevant considerations include \"the legal, statutory and factual contexts in which the decision is made\" and \"the nature of the decision ..., what is involved in making the decision and the identity of the decision maker\".[70] Third, the test is not prescriptive about the ways in which a reasonable apprehension might arise. \"The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty\". Indeed, the apprehension may not even be of a consciously impartial mind. The test encompasses apprehension of unconscious bias: \"the hypotheticalobserver would recognise that judges are human, not a 'passionless thinking machine' or robot just assessing information\".[71] Fourth, the adjective \"lay\" in relation to the fair-minded observer is critical – \"[i]t would defy logic and render nugatory the principle to imbue the hypothetical observer\" with the knowledge and professional self-appreciation of a lawyer, let alone that of an experienced judge. The fair-minded lay observer is a member of the public because the principle is concerned with maintenance of public confidence in the justice system. \"[I]t is the court's view of the public's view, not the court's own view, which is determinative\".Knowledge of the fair-minded lay observer[72]The fair-minded lay observer is taken to be aware of the nature of the decision and the context in which it was made, and the circumstances leading to the decision. The fair-minded lay observer is taken to have \"a broad knowledge of the material objective facts\", as distinct from a detailed knowledge of the law or of the character and ability of the decision-maker. In considering whether an allegation of apprehended bias on the part of a judge is made out, \"the public perception of the judiciary is not advanced by attributing to a fair-minded member of the public a knowledge of the law and the judicial process which ordinary experience suggests is not the case\".[73]As the test is objective, the state of mind of the judge in question is irrelevant. So too are the reasons for judgment given by the judge ex tempore or published by the judge after the trial. The test turns on the facts and circumstances that might give rise to the apprehension of bias at the time of the hearing and determination. For that reason, Bromwich J's reasons are not within the knowledge of the fair-minded lay observer. The material facts stated byhis Honour in his ex tempore reasons should have been provided to the parties in the associate's email or stated in open court during the hearing. That would have allowed the parties to address those facts in their submissions to the Court. It would also have allowed any facts known only to Bromwich J – for example, his level of conscious recollection – to form part of the knowledge of the fair‑minded lay observer, to the extent relevant.”(Footnotes omitted).Relevance was also placed by Mr Howell on the succinct observations of JohnsonJ inGaudie v Local Court of New South Wales(2013) 235 A Crim R 98; [2013] NSWSC 1425 (“Gaudie”) at [87] to [89]:“[87] As the rule is concerned with appearance of bias, and not the actuality, it is the perception of the bystander that provides the yardstick - it is the public's perception of neutrality with which the rule is concerned:British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited v Laurieat 331 [139].[88] The bystander may have regard to the cumulative effect of factors:AJH Lawyers Pty Limited v Careri[2011] VSCA 425; 34 VR 236 at 254-255 [67]-[68]. Later statements may serve to reinforce an impression created earlier:Antoun v The Queenat 52 [2].[89] Similarly, it has been recognised that any statement by a judicial officer which qualifies, corrects, dispels or clarifies what has been said on a prior occasion, may be taken into account by the bystander, and may operate against a finding of apprehended bias:Vakauta v Kelly[1989] HCA 44; 167 CLR 568 at 572, 587;Johnson v Johnsonat 494 [14], 495 [18]. It has been said as well, however, that circumstances may exist where the appearance of bias is ineradicable:Re JRL; Ex parte CJL[1986] HCA 39; 161 CLR 342 at 372.”Ground 1 -disqualification for apprehended biasMr Howell submitted that the Magistrate manifested apprehended bias by reason of his comments to and about the legal representatives appearing for Ms Heywood, his intervention during cross-examination of witnesses, and his gratuitous and belittling comments made during the three hearing days in July 2023 and the return of subpoena argument that took place on 31 October 2022. It was submitted by Mr Howell that no individual event, exchange or comment relied upon established apprehended biason its own, but that it is thecumulative effect of the passages relied on that gave rise to an apprehension that the Magistrate was biased.(i)31 October 2022-return of Subpoenafor Ms Heywood’sUniversity employment recordsOccurring first in time was an issue that arose regardingareturn of a subpoena over which the Magistrate presidedon 31 October 2022. Earlier in the day,asubpoenaissued by NSW Policeseeking documents be produced by Ms Heywood’sUniversityemployer had been mentionedbefore the Magistratebut the policeprosecutorthen appearing,(not Sgt Smithwho wasthePolice Prosecutor with conduct of the matter),hadfailed to obtainaccess for theprosecutionand had accededonlytoa“first access”ordertoMs Heywood’s representatives.The effect of this position was that the police had no access at all to the documents it had subpoenaed.This situation needed to be remedied.The matter was re-mentioned by Sgt Smith. Thetranscript has been reproduced in full asAnnexure 1 to this judgment, as the way the argument developed is intrinsic to the complainant about it andmyconclusions about what occurred.The need to re-mention the matter was raised, and before any submissions were made, the Magistratedirectedthat Mr Taylor be contacted to reappear by AVL.Mr Howell argued thatduring the resumed AVL hearing,the Magistrate spoke over Mr Taylor several times,“stopping him”from making further submissions, and then made apre-emptivedecision-“access to the Crown”- reversing the earlier ruling. He submittedthatthe Magistrate’s toneto Mr Taylor was rude and abruptand that the Magistrate“demanded”written submissionswithin half anhour which was unreasonable and accused Mr Taylor of making submissionsthathe“knew”were incorrect. Mr Howell also submitted that the request that Mr Taylor“undertake”to return the documents was unnecessary,and impliedthatMr Taylor could not be trusted.(ii) Assessment of signs of apprehended bias during the return of subpoena hearingUnfortunately,the languageMr Taylorusedsuggested thatthe prosecution should not be given access to the documentsat all, which was not an appropriate submission to make.The audio file demonstratedthat on occasion bothMr Taylorand theMagistrate began speaking at exactly the same time. They were,in effect,cutting each other off. More than onceMr Taylorusedan exasperatedand defensive toneandinterrupted theMagistrate after theMagistrate had been speaking for some seconds.Thiscan be afeature ofAVLadvocacy,(and it is difficult to assess theactualeffectat the timeofpossibledelaysin transmission),but there does seem to have been an element of what could be interpreted asfrustration andimpatience on the part of theMagistrate to deal with the issue quickly,given more time was nowbeing taken up with the same issue he had already dealt with earlier in the day,and defensiveness byMr Taylor,whohadobtained an order that was favourable to his client earlier in the day,butnowthatorder was to be disturbed. He seemed to have beencaught off-guard andwasnotadequatelyprepared to argue themerits of his maintained position.Mr Taylordid not articulate aproperbasis upon which the issuing partyshould be prevented from viewing the documents,using phrases such as“private information”,or that the documents“may have some sort of privilege”,and“there might be some sort of private information”,and that once theProsecution“sees the documents they can’t be unseen”. These are not validobjectionsto inspection and access.As pointed out by theMagistrate,in a reasonable althoughbrusquetone,documents cannot be deployed in the hearing if they are not admissible, not relevant orareprotected by privilege.TheMagistrate was not persuaded byMr Taylor’sunformed submissions,but stillprovidedafifteenminuteadjournmentforMr Taylorto research the points he seemed to be trying to articulate. Mr Taylor came back with three examples oftheoreticalprivileges which,in the circumstanceshere,could not realisticallyapply. Theexamplesgivenwerein the nature ofpublic interest immunityandsexual assault complainant privilege.The exchange is not a model of courtesy, butis not out ofstepwiththe occasional difficulties of AVL exchangeswhere people speak over each other,noris it inconsistentwith therobustno-nonsenseexchangesthat occurin the Local and other courtswhen what should beasimpleprocedural matteroccupiesmore time thanitshould,partlybecause of the physical absence of a party from the courtroom.Parties were heardandafurtheropportunity given to Mr Taylor to prepare oral submissions. Ultimately theMagistrate adjourned the issue toa date inNovember. Thedocuments previously provided to the agent for Mr Taylor were ordered to be returned.The status quo wasrestored.It appears thatthe issueof accesswaslatersorted out between the parties,as it should have been to begin with.There was nothing extraordinary,in my view,in requiring an undertaking from the solicitor to ensure documents were returned.That has been, in my experience, standard practice adopted by many judicial officers.There is nothing in the tone or conductof the Magistrateon this date that adds any weight at all to the assertion of apprehended biaswhen consideredeitherprospectively, or retrospectively.Complaint is made by Mr Howell that his Honour adjourning the matter on 14November 2022 to a January 2023 date was inappropriate and that requiring Mr Taylor’s physical appearance was unreasonable. I do not agree. The requirements on 31 January 2023 for the parties then present to go outside and“sort it out”is also not a valid cause for complaint. It is consistent with ss56to 60of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW),directing parties to approach disputes in a way that saves court time. The fact that Mr Taylor is retained in a matterlistedfor hearingina different stateand locationto the physical location of his office,is not a basis for preferential treatment.4 July 2023-first day of hearing- first complaint - timeframe for documentsThe hearing commencedbefore the Magistrate with the accused represented byMrPappas, barrister, with Mr Howell(as juniorcounselin a non-speaking role),instructed by Mr Taylor, solicitor.A policeprosecutor,Sgt Smith,appearedfor theprosecution.Prior to this,a different Magistrate had granted leave for theInformant childto give evidence by AVL fromRockingham inWestern Australia, where shewasthen livingwith her parents.A question arose immediatelyabout whetherthedocuments the complainant would requirefor cross-examinationhad been providedto the relevant location.Thetimein Rockinghamwas twohours behindArmidale.11:00aminArmidale was9:00am in Rockingham:“PAPPAS: Before your Honour does that, I wonder if I can just raise a housekeeping matter that I raised with the sergeant. Yesterday afternoon, solicitors from my instructor’s Perth office attempted to lodge some documents at Rockingham Local Court so that they might be available for the complainant to look at during her cross examination today. They were told, that is the solicitors were told, that the Court would not accept the documents. I don’t quite understand why and I’m hoping that your Honour might be in a position this morning to facilitate the electronic transfer of those documents through this registry to the registry at Rockingham so that when we get to that stage, the documents are available to the complainant.HIS HONOUR: Okay. Will that be possible? We’ll have a shot at it. Your instructing solicitor can produce the documents in ten minutes to the registry, he can go up and do it now.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.”[24]Complaintismade by Mr Howell that the Magistrate“demanded”the solicitor attend to the task“in ten minutes”and that that presented timeframe was unreasonable given that at a later point that morning, the Magistrate allowed the policeprosecutor a ten-minute break while a police witness was located.There is nothing at all surprising,let alonedemanding,aboutthe Magistrate’srequest that a timeframe be put around delivery of documents.It is important for the smooth running of thehearing that relevant documents make their way to the right place so that theInformant can be cross-examined andpotentialdelaysto that processare minimised. No doubt a timeframe within which the Rockingham Local Court can expect to receive the documents is also relevant to managing the situation.This exchange adds nothing at all to thequestionof apprehension of bias, when considered on its own, or in combination with all of the other matters of which complaintis made.Early and“unnecessary”objections by Sgt Smithand Magistrate’s tone suggesting intolerance of counsel?Mr Howell complained that Sgt Smith objected early and unnecessarily to cross-examination of thefirst witness called,theOfficer in Charge of the investigation, and that his Honour’swordsand tone suggested intolerance of counsel:“Q.Plain Clothes Senior Constable, in what circumstances was it that you were asked to take over this investigation?A.I was allocated this case by our criminal investigations supervisor.Q.Well, yes. Presumably you were told something about why you were taking over the case, were you?A.I believe it was a - a high media interest.Q.Someone told you that, did they?A.Yep. We had a discussion in regards to why that was the case.Q.Who was it that told you that that was the reason you should take over the investigation?PROSECUTOR: Objection toHIS HONOUR: Yes. Where is this going, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: I’ve got to start somewhere, your Honour, and at the moment there is no objection, as I understand it. I’m happy to expressHIS HONOUR: Just proceed.PAPPASQ.I think I’ve asked you who was it that asked you to take over the investigation.A.Like, I - I can’tPROSECUTOR: Objection. That was asked and answered, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What was the answer?PROSECUTOR: He can - you can - it wasHIS HONOURQ.What was the answer?A.Yeah. I believe - I believe, like, I - I had a discussion with my supervisor and - and I was allocated the case.PAPPASQ.And I’ve asked who was that person?A.Well, my - my supervisor at the time was Acting Sergeant Matthew Robinson.Q.Did he tell you that there’d been some agitation from outside the police force for this matter to proceed?A.Not agitation, no.Q.Well, he may not have used that word. What did he say to you about outside interest in this matter proceeding?A.Nothing to do with outside interest. It was - I believe it was investigated initially by general duties however it was then referred to the Armidale Criminal Investigation Unit.Q.Do you remember the date that you took over the investigation?A.Not the exact date. I believe I made that reference in my statement from our case notes.Q.If I suggested to you that it was 11 May 2022, does that accord with any recollection you have?A.Definitely May. Yes.Q.Did you learn on 11 May 2022 that the local member of parliament, Adam Marshall MP had been writing to the police urging police to take action against my client?PROSECUTOR: Objection to that statement.HIS HONOUR: Why?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, first of all, it’s cross examination and this is - he’s asking for an opinion about an outside source that this officer couldn’t possibly know about. So, to askHIS HONOUR: Well, he can give evidence of what was said to him by his supervisor, if anything, about the substance of this question so to that extent I’ll allow the question.PAPPASQ.Would you like me to repeat the question?A.Yes, please.Q.Were you told by anyone, in factHIS HONOUR: No, that’s not what I allowed, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Well, I withdrawHIS HONOUR: Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Sorry, your Honour, I don’t wish to talk over you.HIS HONOUR: Yes. Just listen to what I’m saying.PAPPAS: Yes, I will, of course.HIS HONOUR: Rephrase the question, Mr Pappas and proceed.PAPPASQ.I’ll withdraw the question that I asked, and I’ll ask this question. Were you told when you took over this investigation, by anyone, that the local member of parliament, Adam Marshall MP had written to police urging them to charge my client with an offence?A.No.Q.Did you subsequently learn about that?PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: Yes. Vague question, Mr Pappas. More specificity is required, you know that.PAPPAS: No, I don’t know that, I’m sorry, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Ask the question in a specific way, please.PAPPAS: Your Honour, thatHIS HONOUR: When? When are you talking about, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: I asked whether the officer learned at any time subsequently, there’s nothing wrong with that as a question.HIS HONOUR: A very general question.PAPPAS: It is.HIS HONOUR: Answer the question, Detective Sergeant.WITNESS: I can answer half of that question. Yes I – subsequently I was aware that Mr Marshall had wrote to the police.”[25]Mr Howell complained thatthe objection at the fourth question had no proper basis and that the Magistrate interrupted when Mr Pappas sought to rephrasethe question. He argued that the Magistrate’s tone was derisive and that he implied that Mr Pappas was acting improperly or incompetentlyor both.I do not agree this complaint is made out. His Honour is attempting toassist in directingthe track and tone of the cross-examination to relevant matters. I do not agree the tone was derisive. It was pointed.Soon afterthis,the followingobjection was made and debatedwith Mr Pappas not being prepared to accept the ruling of the Court:“Q.I see. Now, as at May 2022, I imagine having regard to your rank you’d been a police officer for some time?A.Yes.Q.Roughly how long?A.20 years.Q.You had in that in 20-year period of experience learned, I imagine, that it is sometimes very important when you put an allegation to someone, tell them why they’re being investigated, to make a note of their response.PROSECUTOR: Objection to that question, your Honour. That was very longwinded and it’s making a statement, a generalised statement about character.HIS HONOUR: Yes. A few questions you need to ask before you ask that question, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: With great respect, that is simply not so, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: It is. Ask him whether he actually recorded the response, for example, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: I have asked whether he made a note.HIS HONOUR: No, you haven’t, Mr Pappas. Just proceed.PAPPAS: Well, your Honour, I’m not here doing my first hearing in a Magistrates Court, and it is not helpful to have the Sergeant interrupt that cross examination which is absolutely according to Hoyle.HIS HONOUR: That is what happens in a Magistrates Court, it’s what’s happened in this Court ever since I’ve been a Magistrate. Just proceed, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Well, then perhaps it shouldn’t be happening, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Don’t waste my time.PAPPAS: I’m not wasting your Honour’s time, I’mHIS HONOUR: Yes, you are. Proceed.PAPPAS: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Ask your question.PAPPAS: I have a job to do, and I intend to do it.HIS HONOUR: Ask your questions.PAPPAS: I have asked the question. I’ll ask it again.HIS HONOUR: Yes, do so. Please, sir.”[26]Mr Howell submitted that this exchange showedthe Magistrate endorsing an objection without any properbasis and keptsaying“proceed”or“just proceed”or“ask your question”suggesting impatience with counsel and disinterest.Whilst annoyance is betrayed in the tone of the Magistrate,the stentorian,slow and labouring tone and contentof the cross-examination was notable. I do not agree that the objection was not a valid one. More patience could perhaps have been extended when Mr Pappas made the speech drawing attention to his assertedexperience,but this exchange remains in the category of unfortunate,andnot one thatmight cause afair-mindedlay observer to notice anythinguntoward.Overzealous objectionsAnoverzealousobjection wastakenbySgt Smithin the followingexchange, but Mr Pappas,rather than moving on, the objection having been quickly overruledby the Magistrate, madegratuitous and insultingpersonal criticism ofSgt Smith referring to“fatuousobjections”,and accusing herof makingthisobjection,(andit seemstheprecedingobjections which by thenwereonlylimitedinnumber),to be“disruptive”:“Q.You’ve spoken of course to a number of witnesses, haven’t you?A.That’s correct.Q.And they’ve explained to you where they were and what they saw on 8 March 2022?PROSECUTOR: Objection again to adducing evidence of other witnesses through this witness.HIS HONOUR: It’s a fair question. I’ll allow it.PAPPAS: It’s not the purpose of the question, as it will be obvious to your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ll allow it, I said.PAPPAS: Yes. The problem is, your Honour, as I tried to explain in my earlier exchange with your Honour, fatuous objections are disruptive and unnecessary.(Emphasisadded).HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas. Please proceed.”[27]Mr Howell submitted thatthis was the second time counsel raised the extent of the prosecutor’s objections and their lack of merit butthe Magistratewas indifferent tocounsel’s request for assistance.Instead he was hurriedonto continue, and the Magistrate“cut offanywider discussion”.There was no need for wider discussion. Counsel was being offensive. The ruling was made. It was not the time for a speech from counsel.Criticism of counsel for unclear questionA questionthenput to the policewitnessby Mr Pappasas to whereit was thatthe police officer“thought”thatthe eventshadoccurred was rightly rejected after valid objection was taken:“Q.And walk along the area described as, “Landing,” you will come to another area altogether, described as, “Auditorium.” It’s not marked on this plan at all. Now, is that where you thought that these events occurred?PROSECUTOR: Objection to relevance from this witness, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What’s the objection?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, he’s being asked, and he’s answered the question of what he knows of the room. Now he’s being asked general questions about rooms and his knowledge of it, not going to the facts in issue in this matter.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I agree with that. I overrule the question. Not relevant the way it was put. You can put it another way and maybe it could become relevant.PAPPASQ.You agree with me, I think, that this diagram fairly represents the upstairs function room area at the Armidale Ex Services Memorial Club?A.So, if we’re talking about this diagram, where you’re saying the - the event was held, I actually thought it was the - the - the room at the far right of that landing.Q.I’ll just repeat the question. Do you agree that this diagram represents an area that is at the top of the stairs as you go upstairs slightly to the right and not the area to the far right that you believed was the area where the International Women’s Day event occurred?PROSECUTOR: Objection again to this.HIS HONOUR: Yes. Ask the question clearly, Mr Pappas. He’s already told you, Mr Pappas that he’s not really aware of which room this function was held in so what do you want to ask him?PAPPASQ.Do you agree that this diagram, sir, represents an upstairs function room at the Armidale Ex Services Memorial Club?A.I’ve never been in that room so.”[28]Shortbreak allowed for the Prosecution to locate the next witnessShortly after thisexchange,thepolicewitness’sevidence was completed and there was asix-to-seven-minutedelay while anotherpolice witness was located and called.The following exchange occurred:“HIS HONOUR: The next witness?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the next witness would be the complainant however I don’t believe that witness is available so if I could just have a minute, I will just confer with the next witness in the meantime. The next witness I’ll call is a police officer, Christopher Jordan.HIS HONOUR: Name of the officer?PROSECUTOR: It’s Christopher Jordan.PAPPAS: I have no objection to this officer’s statement being tendered, if that assists.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.PROSECUTOR: It’s a two-page statement.HIS HONOUR: It has to be identified first.PROSECUTOR: Yes. I’ll tender it now and show it to him.HIS HONOUR: It has to be identified first.PROSECUTOR: Right. Okay.SHORT ADJOURNMENT”[29]Mr Howellsubmittedthat there is“an obviousconflictbetween theMagistrate’s“placid response to this period of delay”when compared with the treatment of Mr Taylor being required to“hurry up”and submit the documentsnecessary for cross-examination of the Informantto the Registrywhenthe hearing commenced that morning.This is a strained interpretation of events.I have already concluded that the timeframe placed around the transmission of documentsat the start of the daywas not unreasonable. Here, clearly,there is an issue regarding a witness’s physical presencewhich needs a moment’s pause. What is not reflectedin the transcript isthatMr Pappasactuallyaskedthat thebreakbe usedforhis clientto go to the bathroom. Thefollowing can be heardon the audiorecording,but is not reflected in thetranscript:“PAPPAS: Your Honour, while there’s this break in the proceedings I wonder if my client could be excused for the purposes of a toilet break?HIS HONOUR: Yes sure.”[30]The complaint regarding theseevents does not add anything to what a fair-minded lay observermight conclude or perceive.They are normaleventsin a hearinginvolving multiple witnesses.The documentsfor cross-examination still hadnot reached RockinghamDespite the steps taken earlier in the day(and the failureby the defenceto havesecuredappropriate arrangements before the hearing commenced),problemsremained regarding the documentssent tothe Court at Rockinghamforthe complainant to accessduring cross-examination:“PAPPAS: Can I raise, your Honour, that housekeeping matter. I understand through my instructing solicitor that there is still some impediment to the various documents, there are seven of them, that we have attempted to have produced at Rockingham Court, and I don’t quite understand what the impediment is, but the Rockingham Courtapparently is not in a position to receive them or make them available to the witness at the remote facility.HIS HONOUR: I understand that to be the case. Yes.PAPPAS: That presents some difficulties because that was not of course anticipated when the prosecution made an application for the evidence to be taken remotely. That application was opposed in the first instance, of course it was granted, and we started the process of trying to get these documents to the Rockingham Court about ten days ago. I don’t know whether your Honour is in any position to assist in relieving the difficulty because--HIS HONOUR: Well, yes, another magistrate made that decision. I’m aware of that. He made it in respect of two witnesses, I believe. Is that your understanding?PAPPAS: It is, your Honour. One is--HIS HONOUR: From my reading of the file this morning on this question, it was opposed by Mr Taylor, who is from Hugo Legal.PAPPAS: It was opposed by me, your Honour. I appeared.HIS HONOUR: You appeared. I don’t know. I don’t have any transcripts or anything, but I do note that the magistrate granted both applications. Prosecutor, do you wish to be heard on this?PROSECUTOR: Well, yes, your Honour. I believe that we’ve sorted it out. We’ve asked the police to print those documents and take them there, and apparently they have. So, we’re hoping that will resolve that problem momentarily. Also, obviously young people are entitled to give their evidence via remote, it’s just that this person no longer resides in this state.HIS HONOUR: I’m not cavilling with Magistrate Prowse’s decision. It’s got nothing to do with me. If that’s an ineffective decision, it can be attended to in a higher court. I will make no comment on the decision that he made, and I make no comment on rights of young persons to give evidence by way of AVL or anything of that kind. As far as I am concerned, all that can happen now is that the police, the prosecution should do what it is required to do, and that is to put in place a mechanism for this evidence to be taken by way of AVL. How long is that going to take?PROSECUTOR: Well, I believe thatHIS HONOUR: You know what Mr Pappas’ concern is, and it’s a valid concern, and from my reading in the last half hour of the papers, I think it was point made by you, Mr Taylor, in your written submissions. So, how long do you need?PROSECUTOR: I believe that they’re there now. Sergeant Tunks is just calling the police officer.PAPPAS: Can I just add for your Honour’s assistance, there should be sevenHIS HONOUR: Seven documents?PAPPAS: marked envelopes, that was the request, marked D1 to D7, and a schedule has been provided with the documents describing each one of D1 through to D7.COURT OFFICER: Excuse me, your Honour, I’ve been given a pile of documents here.HIS HONOUR: Are they marked D1 to D7?COURT OFFICER: Yes, they are, your Honour.”[31]Spurious objections?TheInformant by this timewas17 years old. Shegave her evidence by AVL from Western Australia.Her evidence in chiefwas short.She was cross-examinedin a rathermaladroit fashionby Mr Pappas.Mr Pappascomplained early and frequentlythathiscross-examination wasbeinginterrupted bySgt Smithdeliberately makingspurious objections.Having carefully examined the transcript,I do not accept that as a fair statement.Some objections were overzealous, Sgt Smith evidencing a wish to protect the child from what she perceived to be confusing and unfair questions,and some were incorrect and dismissed accordingly,butMr Pappasseemed to take offence at any objectionsbeing made at all.Umbragewas taken by Mr Pappas to a valid,if notelegantlyarticulatedobjection toacircuitous and confusing question early in the cross-examination:“Q.Do you think then that when you told the prosecutor earlier that at the end of the speech or the speeches you went walking around and just talking to a few people and went towards the back and took a seat with your two friends to consume some food, that that’s something that might have happened a little later in the sequence of events that afternoon?PROSECUTOR: Objection to“later than what?”It might need to be specified.PAPPAS: Your Honour, it would be of very great assistance if when my opponent makes an objection she frames the objection either in a form known to the common law or recognised under the Evidence Act and it’s not helpful to make general objections because my friend doesn’t like the way I ask a question, which seems to be the substance of the objection.PROSECUTOR: The objection is based on the form of the question. He asked a question about a sequence in time without giving a reference to when that time was to be after, and it’s very important that that be articulated.HIS HONOUR: Maybe it just requires a little bit of clarification, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Very well.HIS HONOUR: I know what you’re getting at but maybe just phrase it slightly differently.PAPPAS: I’ll try and perfect the question, your Honour.”[32](Emphasis added).This is an example of theapproach taken byMr Pappasto attackSgt Smithandher skill andexperience,rather thanjustdealingwith the substance of the objection in an appropriatefashion. The tone he used was stentorious andlecturingand the contentwasoffensive and belittling.The Magistrate dealt with it in aneven-handedfashion.Further overzealous objections-descentinto more personalremarks by Mr Pappas, this time directed toboth Sgt Smith and the MagistrateShortly after this, the following exchange occurred:“Q.Now that I have shown you the photograph and asked you all of those questions, do you now remember it or are you still simply willing to accept it happened without having a memory?A.I remember taking the photo but that’s about it.Q.I’m asking you I think a slightly different question. Do you now remember the sequence in the way I’ve been putting to you or are you just accepting that that must be the way it happened?A.I don’t understand the question.Q.I’ll try and make it clear. I’ve suggested to you that the photograph at the front of the room with Prof Heywood was something that happened before you went walking around, talking to a few people, going up the back, having a seat and eating food with your friends. You follow that?PROSECUTOR: Objection.WITNESS: Yes.HIS HONOUR: That’s a fairPROSECUTOR: Yes, but it’s a question that’s been asked and answered. Both questions now.HIS HONOUR: No, I think he’s trying to clarify the question for the witness, so I’ll allow it.PAPPASQ.Do you need me to restate the question, or can you answer it?A.Could you restate it, please?Q.Of course. Now that I have drawn your attention to the fact that you were at the front of the room with your friends and you had a photograph taken with Prof Heywood on this afternoon straight after the end of the speeches, do you accept that walking around, talking to a few people, taking a seat up the back with your friends and eating food must have happened after that?A.Yes.Q.In accepting that, is that simply because it seems logical or because you now have a memory, me having drawn it to your attention?A.Because it seems logical.Q.So, you still have no memory of it independent of any questions I’ve asked. Is that right?A.I remember taking the photo but yeah.Q.Well, “But, yeah,” does that mean, “No, Mr Pappas, I’ve got not the slightest memory of the sequence in which things happened,” is that what that meant?PROSECUTOR: Objection, your Honour, to that. It’s harassing and intimidating of this witness. She’s answered it and now he’s putting forth the statement for an answer. That’s his wording.PAPPAS: That is just a silly and obstructive objection which your Honour needs to control, with great respect.PROSECUTOR: Well, your Honour, he’s still bombing the witness.PAPPAS: There’s been too many of them. There’s been too many of them.HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, Mr Pappas. I won’t have any person speak to me like that.PAPPAS: Sorry, your Honour?HIS HONOUR: I won’t have any person speak to me like that.[said quietly in a crisp tone]PAPPAS: Sorry, is your Honour addressing what I’ve just said?HIS HONOUR: Yes, I do.PROSECUTOR: WellHIS HONOUR: I will govern this Court according to the law and according to my experience and with propriety, sir.PAPPAS: Yes, indeed.HIS HONOUR: She’s made an objection and you have saw fit to belittle it.PAPPAS: Yes, I have.HIS HONOUR: Well, don’t.PAPPAS: Well, I do so.HIS HONOUR: Make your reply to the objection.PAPPAS: I have, and I’ve suggested to your Honour that it is not the first time that an objection has been made without any proper basis.HIS HONOUR: In this Court, and I don’t know what court you appear in Mr Pappas, but you did say something about not often in this Court, I just remind you in this Court it is not unusual for the prosecutor and for defence attorneys to interject regularly during cross examination.PAPPAS: I see.HIS HONOUR: That is what is happening. Perhaps you should become accustomed to that, sir. Ask your question.PAPPAS: No. With great respect, your HonourHIS HONOUR: Don’t “with respect” me, sir. Ask your question.PAPPAS: Your Honour --HIS HONOUR: I am going to warn you. Ask your question.PAPPAS: Your Honour, I will not be bullied.HIS HONOUR: I’m not bullying you.PAPPAS: You are, your Honour, I’m sorry.HIS HONOUR: I am asking you to ask your question.PAPPAS: I have a job to do, and I am asking your Honour to control the conduct of the sergeant who --HIS HONOUR: She’s made her objection known. What is your response to it?PAPPAS: My response is there was nothing wrong with the question I asked.HIS HONOUR: What is the question? That’s what I’m trying to get you to repeat. What is the question? Ask your question.”[33](Emphasis added)The tone usedin this exchange is important. The Magistrate’s tone was crispandquiet. It is evidentthattheMagistrateconsidered,(correctly),thatMr Pappaswasbullying Sgt Smith byusingunduly personal and insultingterms to articulate his response to herobjectionand deliberately insulting the Magistrate’s competence in managing the proceedings. It is important to control the court’s process and to cut short, if possible,poor behaviour byone legal practitionertowards another, particularly where one is counselof someyears’experienceand the person beingcriticised, and, to an extent,bullied,isa policeprosecutorof apparently less experience.Mr Howell submitted that this exchange demonstratedthat counsel was trying to“bring to a head”the fact that the police prosecutor was objecting to questions without any proper basis.That is an overly generous view of what was occurring here. Counsel was unacceptably rude. I do not accept the Magistrate was ignoring the“substance”of counsel’s complaintalthough it could have been managed with more equanimity. Counsel’s complaint was exaggerated and overblown.Mr Howell also complained the Magistrate was patronising, as if to suggest counsel might not understand how objections in the Local Court are dealt with.He submitted that the repetition of“what isthe question”was openlymockingMr Pappas. In using thisapproachhe was simultaneouslybullying andberating Mr Pappas.The exchangewasrobust and unfortunate. The tonehere hasbegun to shiftawayfromone of maintainingcontrolofthe Court’s proceedings,tobeingovertlycritical of counsel. Thecorrectionof theunduly personalapproachthat Mr Pappas had takenwasvalidas was the request for Mr Pappas to identify his question,but the tone and language used by the Magistratetoachievethat re-directionwasbeginningadescenttowardsinsult. To say counsel was being“warned”in the context of the exchange, adds to the impression that counsel was doing something very wrong.A different question then allowedThe exchange continued with Mr Pappasreading out ontothe record Mr Howell’s note of the question. That note contained the substance of the question, but notthe edge with which Mr Pappas hadinitiallyput it to the young person,which had carried with ita questionabletone andapotentially confusing manipulation of her evidence:“PAPPAS: Would your Honour bear with me.HIS HONOUR: You don’t recall the question?PAPPAS: No, I don’t, now. That’s the very - that’s the very nub of my--HIS HONOUR: All right. Would your junior please read out the question?HOWELL: You asked her what she meant by, “I just remember the photo, but yeah,” and then you were saying to her, “What do you mean by the words, ‘but yeah’?”PAPPAS: Thank you. I don’t know whether your Honour wishes to mute the connection whilst I--HIS HONOUR: I just want you to repeat the question.PAPPAS: I’m certainly happy to do so.HIS HONOUR: Well, do so.PAPPAS: The witness had said, “I remember the photo, but yeah.” I had put to the witness that that in essence meant, “I remember the photograph being taken, but I’ve got no independent recollection of the sequence of events that afternoon.” So, I was putting that to the witness by way of clarification of what she might have meant by, “I remember the photo, but yeah.”HIS HONOUR: That flows out of the cross examination. It’s a logical question to ask as a consequence of the cross examination. Ask the question.”[34]The question then asked was different in nature and toneofthe one to which objection was taken. Thesarcastic“edge”wasremoved and theconfusing aspect to itthat the (child) witness somehow“owed”her response to“Mr Pappas”,or that she was in some way beholden to himin the way she gives her evidence,was now absent:Q.Ms[REDACTED],I think you gave an answer some few minutes ago now to this effect, “I remember the photograph, but yeah.” Do you remember saying that?A.Yes.Q.What I seek to ask you is do you mean by that that having seen the photograph you can remember it was taken but you have no independent recollection of the sequence of events that afternoon?A.I remember the sequence of events and I do remember taking the photo.”[35]Further “interrupting” objectionsAlittle later,thisobjection was taken:“Q.You’ll agree, I think, that the subject of the various speeches that afternoon was the difficulties faced by women in leadership roles, was one of the things being discussed?PROSECUTOR: Objection.WITNESS: I can’t remember, sorry.HIS HONOUR: What’s the objection?PROSECUTOR: Is he asking whether that was a conversation she heard or whether that was the subject of the speech? I think it’s confusing for this witness.HIS HONOUR: No, he’s asking whether that was the content of the speeches. Ask the question.”[36]Mr Howell submitted that this was another deliberately interruptingand invalidobjection. It wasgiven short shrift by the Magistrate.It was an overzealous objection, and was treated accordingly.Unprovoked pontification by Mr Pappas leads to a crisp response from the MagistrateThis is followed bywhat appears to be a deliberate misunderstandingby Mr Pappasof the Magistrate’s request to respond to the objectiontakenin the following exchange. Whenthe Magistrate asks Mr Pappas:“What do you want to say”, insteadof respondingtothe objection,Mr Pappasunhelpfullypontificatesabout the purposes of cross-examination:“Q.Would you accept from me that at that stage of the afternoon, there were a number of people milling at the front of the area delineated in that diagram I showed you before with the seats set out, that is at the front of that area immediately in front of what I suggested were barstools.PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: What’s the objection?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, this witness has answered to the question of how many people were around. She’s now being asked to make opinions about places that aren’t in her direct purview in any event. She’s answered about how many people were inher direct vicinity and I would say that she can’t answer about the front of the room or other places.HIS HONOUR: What do you want to say, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: I want to say, your Honour, that I am engaging in a process of cross‑examination. I am entitled to test the witness’ recall, to test what she has said and what she has not said. By my cross‑examination thus far, I have changed the narrative from that which was given in chief. That’s a fair illustration of the very purpose and the effect of cross‑examination.HIS HONOUR: It’s for me to decide whether you’ve actually succeeded in doing anything. But you ask the question.PAPPAS: Is your Honour allowing that question?HIS HONOUR: I will. Ask the question.PAPPASQ.When you were at the front of the room listening to Prof Heywood talking to Ms Kennedy, would you accept that there were a number of people milling in that area of the room?A.I don’t remember.”[37](Emphasis added).An objection with no substance,but sarcasm wasused by the Magistrate to Mr PappasThe cross-examination proceeded for a while uneventfully and then aone-houradjournment for lunchwastaken.[38]A short time laterafter resuming after lunch,the following exchangeoccurred:“Q.But you’d accept, I think, that the other adults, whoever they were, were generally to your left?A.From what I can remember, Brooke Kennedy was in front of me, Brigid Heywood was to my right and that’s all I remember. But the adults, I do not remember where they were standing.Q.I thought only a second ago you had conceded that they were largely to your left?A.They could be, yeah.Q.When you say they could be, is that just a guess, is it?PROSECUTOR: Just objection, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What’s the objection?PROSECUTOR: The witness answered that she didn’t know where the other adults were and now it was put back to her that a minute ago she said something that she didn’t say, your Honour. So, I’d be saying that that’s misleading and confusing to this vulnerable witness.HIS HONOUR: What do you want to say, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: Sorry, I was just listening to my junior. What was your Honour’s comment?HIS HONOUR: Sorry, you’ve got other matters to deal with, have you?PAPPAS: Sorry?HIS HONOUR: What are you dealing with?PAPPAS: I can’t hear, your Honour. I’m not being rude; I just can’t quite hear.HIS HONOUR: I said what do you want to say?PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour. The objection has no substance. The witness had made what I suggest to her quite properly was a concession. She then qualified that concession in a later answer and I’m simply seeking to clarify where there is preference for one or the other.HIS HONOUR: What is the question? Do you want to confer with your junior again about it? What’s the wording of the question?PAPPAS: Your Honour, I--HIS HONOUR: Off you go.PAPPAS: Thank you, I will. The answer that was given was, “They could have been to my left.” I simply asked the witness whether that was a concession that what she had said earlier was accurate, that they were to her left.HIS HONOUR: Is that what he asked, Prosecutor?PROSECUTOR: No.HIS HONOUR: It’s not my record of what he asked.PAPPAS: And I--HIS HONOUR: Ask your junior what you actually did ask.PAPPAS: I asked whether it was a guess, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No, you didn’t. Ask your junior what the wording was.PAPPAS: No, I don’t intend to do so, thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Conference with your legal team, sir. I run this Court, not you.PAPPAS: I will withdraw.HIS HONOUR: Withdraw the question, thank you.PAPPAS: I withdraw the question.HIS HONOUR: I’ve made a note of it.”[39](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted this exchange was sarcastic and belittlingand that itimplied counsel was incompetent. Iagree that is an available interpretation and a fair-minded lay observer may well hold that view.There was then the following exchange immediately after:“PAPPASQ.When you were at the front of the room and you were facing Brooke Kennedy, you specifically remember that Prof Heywood was to your right? Is that right?A.Yep.Q.How close was Prof Heywood to you?A.I don’t remember how close, but she was standing to my right.Q.Was she within arm’s reach of you?A.Yes.Q.Were there any other people to your right that you noticed?A.I don’t remember.Q.When Prof Heywood spoke in the way you’ve described, did you look at her?A.I don’t recall if I looked at her, but I definitely heard her.Q.Is it possible, do you think, that you looked at her, turned to look at her?PROSECUTOR: Objection. Asked and answered.HIS HONOUR: Yes, we’re getting close to s 40, but ask it again. Can you remember the question, Mr Pappas, this time?PAPPAS: Yes, I can, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Well, ask it again.PAPPAS: There is absolutely no need for your Honour to be rude to me.HIS HONOUR: I’m not being rude to you.PAPPAS: Your Honour is being gratuitously rude.HIS HONOUR: But you seem to entirely rely on your junior to remind you what the question was.PAPPAS: No, your Honour is being gratuitously rude and it’s not necessary.HIS HONOUR: I’m not being gratuitously rude. I just asked you to remember what the question is so that we can debate whether it’s a valid question or not.PAPPAS: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Move on.PAPPAS: Now your Honour is raising your voice and shouting at me.HIS HONOUR: I’m not being - I’m just asking you to move on.PAPPAS: Your Honour is shouting at me.HIS HONOUR: I apologise, Mr Pappas but I am probably going to warn you under s 40 unless you pull this together. First warning. Proceed.PAPPAS: Sorry, I don’t understand a first warning.HIS HONOUR: I think you’re getting very close to being in breach of that Evidence Act provision that precludes you asking questions that are harassing and intimidatory in nature given this is a young person who clearly on her evidence has had some issues since this alleged offence occurred. First warning, Mr Pappas. Proceed.PAPPAS: Your Honour, there isHIS HONOUR: Proceed or I’ll ask you to be removed from the Court. Proceed.”[40](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted thatthe sarcasm deployed by the Magistrate in:“Sorry, you’ve got other matters to deal with, have you?”was belittling andfurthercalled the conductand competenceof Mr Pappas into question.Thesuggestion Mr Pappas should bephysically removedis unambiguous and humiliating.The tonewasdeeplysarcastic andcritical. Afair-mindedlay observer mightreasonablyconclude that the Magistratewastaking a very dim view of Mr Pappas’s skills,probity andattention to his task. The exchange then deterioratedto a“push and shove”between Mr Pappas and the Magistrate,ending with a threat that Mr Pappas will be removed if he does not“proceed”.This is frankly a shocking suggestionandhas well crossed the line from a“shortemotionalexchange”into something entirely more serious.The cross-examination of theInformantthencontinuedas follows withan unfortunately phrased question at the end thatprompted derisionfrom the Magistrate:“PAPPASQ.Do you think it is reasonably likely that when someone spoke to you, that is Prof Heywood spoke to you, you turned to face her?A.I don’t remember.Q.When you went outside and spoke to your friends, your evidence before lunch was that you spoke to both of them together?A.Yes.Q.Do you know what the word, “Demeanour,” means?A.Not quite.Q.How were you at that stage? Were you visibly upset; do you think?PROSECUTOR: Objection. Your Honour, she can’t comment on whether she was visibly upset.HIS HONOUR: Yes, of course she can’t. Why don’t you ask a question she can answer. Was she upset? Was she crying?PAPPAS: Would your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Visibly upset is not something she can answer. Just think about it, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: I am thinking about it, your Honour. I’ve been doing this for a very long time.HIS HONOUR: Apparently.PAPPAS: Well, your HonourHIS HONOUR: Just move on and ask the question in a way in which she can answer.PAPPAS: No, I will not be bullied and moved on. Your HonourHIS HONOUR: Ask the question in a way this witness can answer it.PAPPAS: Your Honour is making this an impossible task by your Honour’s constant interaction with me in this fashion.HIS HONOUR: With respect, Mr Pappas, it’s you that is making it a difficult task.PAPPAS: No, not so, sir.HIS HONOUR: When you ask - yes, you are, with respect. Ask the question, please.PAPPAS: Prefacing it with, “With respect,” doesn’t make it a fairer hearing.HIS HONOUR: That’s what I said to you earlier on.PAPPAS: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Just ask the question, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: I seek the indulgence of a short adjournment to take instructions, please, your Honour.”[41](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submittedthat the Magistrate was openly mocking counsel. He was. There was contempt for counsel’s ability to ask an adequate question.Overzealous premature objections not“controlled” by the MagistrateOn occasion,Sgt Smith’sobjectionswereprematureandoverzealous.Thisis one of them.Sgt Smithwas given shortshriftby the Magistrate, withsuccinctreasons:“PROSECUTOR: I just make an objection under s 44 of the Evidence Act in relation to this, your Honour, and the question that was asked. This witness cannot comment on any document produced by somebody else, they can agree words are written there but it cannot be cross examined on the content.HIS HONOUR: All right. We’ll see what happens. I’ve noted the objection is under s 44.ENVELOPE D7 SHOWN TO WITNESSPAPPASQ.Just take your time to read quietly to yourself--PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, s 44 objection, I think it needs to be stipulated thatHIS HONOUR: I don’t even know what the document is. I’ve got no idea. It’s just an envelope with a piece of paper in it. So, Mr Pappas is going to do a lot of work to try and establish the authenticity of the document and what it is, et cetera. I’m not in a position to rule on it. It just could be a blank piece of paper, as far as I’m aware. You know what it is, do you?PROSECUTOR: I have an idea what it is. I don’t know exactly.HIS HONOUR: I have no idea what it is so, Mr Pappas, I’ll leave it to you.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.PROSECUTOR: But it could be to thisHIS HONOUR: I don’t know what it is. Do you want to tender the document so we can have an argument about admissibility of the evidence under s 44, I’ll go into a voir dire and this witness can be excused and can come back tomorrow, if that’s what it’s going to take. Mr Pappas?PAPPASQ.All I’m asking you, Ms[REDACTED],at the moment, is just to read quietly to yourself the document which I’ve made available to you. Once you’ve done that, take your time, just let me know once you’ve read it all.PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I have to object. It’s an inappropriate format to be done before your Honour has looked at this document, considering my objection.”[42]At this pointtheMagistrate expressed frustration withSgt Smith,not Mr Pappas, given Sgt Smith’s apparent difficulty with understanding theprocessbeing adopted here by Mr Pappas:“HIS HONOUR: All right. In that case, we’ll adjourn the case until tomorrow and I will seek written submissions on the objections if necessary. Thank you for your evidence today. We’ll resume tomorrow at 9.30 and that is on the assumption that these objections will take some time.PROSECUTOR [SIC: HOWELL]: Why is he adjourning the case?PAPPAS: I don’t know. I’m happy to deal with the objection now.HIS HONOUR: Hand up the Evidence Act, please, Prosecutor. It’s your objection. Where is the section?PROSECUTOR: 44.HIS HONOUR: Yes, where’s the section?PROSECUTOR: It’s in the Evidence Act. I can get that printed out.HIS HONOUR: Yes, but where is a copy of it, please?PROSECUTOR: Yes.HIS HONOUR: I’ll adjourn the Court and go and get my own copies.SHORT ADJOURNMENTSection 44, you say?PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour.PAPPAS: Your Honour, could the witness be muted whilst this debate takes place?HIS HONOUR: Yes. Certainly.”[43]After some unedifying submissions fromSgt Smithand some apparent misunderstandings,theMagistrateeffectivelyruledin favour of Mr Pappas,but Mr Pappaswasnot contentwith the rulingwhichMr Pappasinterpreted,apparently, as“the end”of any further exploration of the documents,rather than the Magistratecommunicatingthatheunderstood the argumentand wanted to moveon with thequestioning on thedocument.Sgt Smithseemed not tounderstandthatthe document extracted from subpoenaed recordscouldbeadmissible, in that context,as abusinessrecordand was quite obdurate about it being unfair to put it in his way to a vulnerable witness.Unfortunately, rather thanmake a formal call on the subpoenaed material and/orexplain courteously to his opponent before its deployment - or at least at the time ofitsdeployment - the provenance of the document and its relevance and role,Mr Pappaswaitedto the end of the exchange toexplainthose matters. Exchanges became unnecessarily heatedas a result ofthisapproach.His Honour ruledin a wayin favour ofallowingquestioning onthe document,butindicating perhaps a preliminary view as to weight.Instead of proceedingwith the witness,the afternoonderailed:“HIS HONOUR: It’s just notes on the doctor’s file, that’s all it is but I can’t see why 44(3) rules out that being put to this witness under 44(3)(c).PROSECUTOR: Okay.HIS HONOUR: That’s the end of it.PAPPAS: Well, sorry, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You want to take it further?PAPPAS: I do.HIS HONOUR: Written submissions, thank you. Written submissions.PAPPAS: It’s a very simple--HIS HONOUR: Written submissions, Mr Pappas. It’s my Court, not yours.PAPPAS: Yes, indeed.HIS HONOUR: All right. How long is it going to take the parties to prepare written submissions? I’ve made an indication to try and push this thing along. Your client is nodding her head with approval. Do you wish to confer with your client?PAPPAS: No.HIS HONOUR: Written submissions. How long do you seek, Prosecutor? You can ask for as long as you like. What’s reasonable and fair?PROSECUTOR: On an objection just written. I mean, I can’t do them - your Honour, the matter’s listed tomorrow and the next day. I will endeavour to have them for tomorrow, if that’s fair, for 11.30, if that’s the time that this witness will be back.HIS HONOUR: We have a DPP list tomorrow. It will be 2 o’clock.PROSECUTOR: Okay.HIS HONOUR: Then we have a Children’s Court list on Thursday.PROSECUTOR: On Thursday.HIS HONOUR: I made that very clear to Mr Taylor when this matter was listed. It’s two half days.PROSECUTOR: Yes.HIS HONOUR: How long do you require to go into written submissions.PROSECUTOR: Your Honour --HIS HONOUR: Just tell me what you require, and I will hear whatever other evidence you have. I’m part heard in this matter, we’ll just press on and we’ll put this witness on abeyance until such a time as I make a ruling, which might be this year, it might be next year.PROSECUTOR: This witness, I know that they - just give me one moment, your Honour.PAPPAS: Whilst the sergeant’s conferring, your Honour, we can reduce our argument to writing by as early as you like tomorrow morning.PROSECUTOR: I have a DPP list tomorrow morning, you won’t be before 2 o’clock.PAPPAS: No, I heard what your Honour had to say in that regard.HIS HONOUR: Mr Taylor was fully aware of that when this matter was listed.PAPPAS: I think Mr Taylor suggested that it was a three-day matter and your Honour resisted that.HIS HONOUR: I said I’d give you one day today and two half days. I made it very clear.PAPPAS: Yes. All I’m saying--HIS HONOUR: I’m quite prepared to go part heard, and I can tell you the first hearing date in this Court is November so it’s going to go into next year. It’s a matter for you and your client. Prosecutor, what do you want to say?PROSECUTOR: Well, your Honour, I accept your proposition for 44(3)(c) to happen but my friend is going to go further.HIS HONOUR: Mr Pappas does not accept it.PROSECUTOR: So, I’m happy to have written submissions prepared by tomorrow for 2 o’clock but I don’t know what, given it’s Mr Pappas thatHIS HONOUR: Then they’ll have to be given to Mr Pappas so he can review them and reply. When do you think you’re going to reply?PAPPAS: I won’t need a reply, your Honour. I’m perfectly happy to hang my colours on the mast with our written submissions. It’s a simple argument and that is that subs (2) governs the admissibility of what I’m doing.HIS HONOUR: Subsection (2) of what section?PAPPAS: Of that s 40.HIS HONOUR: No, it doesn’t. It’s a question of whether it’s admissible or not.PAPPAS: Well, it does, with respect, your Honour. The permission in subs (2)HIS HONOUR: Depends on whether it is likely to be admitted or whether it’s admissible.PAPPAS: That’s right. It’s produced on subpoena as a business record. Section 69 makes it admissible.HIS HONOUR: Yes.PAPPAS: So, your Honour would be satisfied that it will be admitted.HIS HONOUR: This is all what the prosecutor is going to have to address.PAPPAS: So, I don’t need to respond to that, and I don’t.“HIS HONOUR: YOU WILL BE RESPONDING TO IT IN WRITING, SIRTHANK YOU. SO, BY 2 O’CLOCK, YOU CAN PRODUCE YOUR SUBMISSIONS, PROSECUTOR, ADDRESSING ALL THE POINTS?PROSECUTOR: Yes.HIS HONOUR: I WILL GIVE YOU AN HOUR THEREAFTER TO PRODUCE YOUR RESPONSE. I WILL MAKE A RULING MAYBE AT 4 O’CLOCK TOMORROW, thank you.ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO WEDNESDAY 5 JULY 2023 AT 2.00PM.”[44]Mr Howell submitted thatthis indicated that rather than hear further from counsel, suchwas his level of frustration,the Magistratepreferred to adjourn a full hour early.He offered no alternative to written submissions:“It’s my Court, not yours”,and then indicated that the Court would not sit the following day (although a half day had been allocatedfor the hearing),except to“maybe”at 4:00pmthat nextday,give a ruling on the issue that had arisen.Thelastpart of the transcript appears in capitals, as is the practice to indicate final orders andanadjourned date.It appears from Mr Howell’swrittensubmissionsthat this was somehow interpreted as a raised voice or demand. I do notreadit that way, and the audio did not suggest there was a raised voice on the part of the Magistrate. TheCourt is entitled to adjourna hearingif and whenitconsidersappropriate,buthere,given what had gone before, it should have beenwith a clearer explanation as to why,and how the balance of the timeallocatedforthehearing will proceed. To fail to do so was discourteous, although the frustration evidencedby this steptaken by the Magistratewasclearlydirected tobothparties.5 July 2023-second day of hearingTheMagistrate startedthe dayat 2:00pmwith his ruling ons 44 of theEvidence Act 1995(NSW),about which he hadapparentlyreceived written submissions overnight. The decision was succinct andnot the subject of complaintin this Court in terms of its correctness. The judgment concludes:“HIS HONOUR:…What is being said here is that the previous representation is the representation made by the complainant to the doctor and as such in my view, probably falls outside 44 on a literal interpretation of 44(1). Section 44(1) is directed at a different circumstance to this. Then going on from that I agree that it is relevant unlike a lot of questions put in this hearing to date, it is relevant to the issues that are before the Court which are the facts necessary to prove the elements of common assault and the behaviour charge.I do agree that it is a business record exempt under s 69 of the Act, so the hearsay rule does not apply to it. I agree with points 12 and 13 of Mr Pappas's submission. Yes, and I agree, and this has been what it has been all about apart from a couple of questions. It is all about the credibility of the witness and I think that the point made in para 14 is salient, but it is confined to that aspect of para 14. In my view, s 44 is not engaged on a literal interpretation and it is a document upon which the defence counsel, Mr Pappas, can cross examine the complainant, but I will strictly confine the cross examination. Put the witness on the screen.”[45]This was immediately followed by an application for an adjournment to provide time for Mr Pappas to prepare a transcript-based application for recusal:“PAPPAS: Your Honour, I'm sorryHIS HONOUR: Thank you, put the witness on the screen.PAPPAS: I have an application to make.HIS HONOUR: What's the application?PAPPAS: The application is for an adjournment and if I can have a moment to articulate it and go from making notes to reading notes. The defendant seeks an adjournment in order to obtain a copy of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings and the audio recording of yesterday's proceedings to facilitate the making of a properly formulated application that your Honour recuse yourself from further involvement in the hearing of this matter based upon your Honour's apprehended bias. The defendant instructs me to make this application, that is for adjournment, in the interests of the proper administration of justice so that the details of your Honour's conduct said to justify the course, can be put to your Honour in as much detail as possible and as accurately as possible.Some aspects of your Honour's conduct will not be accurately reflected by reference to the transcript alone. Things like the volume, tone, and inflection of your Honour's exchanges with me, with my instructing solicitor, and your Honour's direct observation about the defendant's perceived conduct towards the end of yesterday's proceedings. The application is, simply put, that the defendant seeks the opportunity of obtaining a transcript and an audio recording of yesterday so that she can properly and fully articulate an application for your Honour's recusal.HIS HONOUR: Response Prosecutor?PROSECUTOR: Obviously that would just delay this process, and I'm against an adjournment. We have the young person who was here all day yesterday, and we've got her back today for cross examination. I don't--HIS HONOUR: Thank you, please articulation your application now, Mr Pappas. Adjournment will not be granted. I'll deal with it now. Articulate it.”[46]Mr Howell complained that the 2:00pm start time was only notified minutes before. He also raisedthat the Magistrate madegratuitouslyinsulting comments in the judgment about“irrelevant questions”.On its own,a comment like this may pass unnoticed, but given what had gone before, this adds to the potential for thefair-mindedlay observer tocontinue tothink the Magistrate might not bring an impartial mind, because counsel is“so hopeless”andasks a lot of irrelevant questions.Application by Mr Pappas requesting the Magistrate recuse himself for apprehendedbiasMr Pappasmade the recusalapplication, commencing as follows:“PAPPAS: The first ground of the application is that your Honour has immediately disallowed the application for adjournment, sought in circumstances where the defendant craves the opportunity to prepare in detail a serious application going to the root of the proper administration of justice. The refusal of a reasonable application for adjournment to facilitate that course of action, allowing an application to be supported by affidavit attaching all relevant documentary material so as to afford your Honour a proper opportunity to qualify or clarify or explain your Honour's impugned conduct, may reinforce an impression created by any earlier behaviour and I cite in support of that a High Court decision inAntoun v The Queen[2006] HCA 2at para 52 in medium neutral citation.No matter how the matter proceeds today and tomorrow, having regard to the number of witnesses who are to give evidence in these proceedings it is impossible that it will proceed to finality in the limited time which the Court has allocated and as your Honour suggested in exchanges yesterday, will ofnecessity have to be adjourned either till late this year or early next year. Therefusal of the application for adjournment needs to be seen not in isolation but in combination with the numerous things said and done by your Honour yesterday, which gives rise to the reasonable apprehension in respect of which the defendant complains and gives rise to a reasonable apprehension in themind of a fair minded lay observer, that your Honour might not bring animpartial and open mind to the resolution of the questions that your Honour's required to decide.Your Honour, I imagine, is familiar with the test as articulated in Ebner v Official Trustee, a 2000 decision of the High Court of Australia whichhas been described as the two, \"Mights,\" test. Might a fair-minded lay observer reasonably apprehend that your Honour might not bring an impartial and opened mind to the resolution of the questions you are required to decide. The first step in the process is of course to identify what your Honour has saidor done, or said and done, which might lead you to decide this case on otherthan its legal and factual merits, and I'll come to those matters seriatim in a moment.The second step is to articulate a logical connection between those mattersand the feared departure from deciding the case on its merit and I will addresshat at the end of the articulation of the various matters in combination, and we say that the matters are to be looked at in combination and in essenceyour Honour's conduct towards me as the defendant's counsel and towards my instructing solicitor amounts, or has amounted to derision, contempt, distain,and aggressive behaviour and your Honour's impugned conduct commencedwell before yesterday...”[47]Mr Pappas concludedhis submissions with the following:“…The reasonable observer mightconclude or reason, that you as the presiding magistrate, hold the legal representatives of the defendant in such contempt and regard them as incompetent and an impediment to the just and speedyresolution of these matters. Such a bystander might conclude thatyour Honour has prejudged the question of the complainant's asserted mental health problems said to arise in consequence of the alleged offending, and in all probability has done so, at least in part, by reference to material not properly before you.Theobserver might draw the connection that your Honour has acted towards the defendant's counsel with such unwarranted animus, employing threats and intimidatory behaviour, that your judgment in the matter would be clouded by a disinclination to accept any argument advanced by me as the defendant'scounsel as to the facts or the law. The bystander might conclude that in all ofthe foregoing respects, your Honour's behaviour demonstrates such a lack of calmness, detachment, and objectivity expected of a magistrate performing his or her role properly that the bystander would conclude the accumulative effect might be to divert you from the proper determinationof the defendant'smatters. For all of those reasons your Honour is asked to recuse yourself fromfurther determination of the defendant's matters.”[48]Whilst Mr Pappas started with some restraint, the vehemence in tone with which the application was made,and thehistrionic description of the return of subpoena argument and theloaded and personal criticismsincludedwithin the application,were excessive and unnecessaryin an application for apprehension of bias, which is all about objective perceptions.The application proceeded for seven pages and was described bySgt Smith when it was overas a“40 to 50 minute barrage”which included“offensive comments”against her and her behaviour. The correct test was,however,articulated and argued,and for the reasons I will come to, the applicationought to have been granted.After ashortadjournment,judgment was provided extempore in the terms set out in the second annexure to this judgment.Ground 3 - the wrong legal test was appliedThe judgment thoroughly deals with the matters raised,butunfortunatelymis-statesthe relevant test for apprehended bias ata number ofplaces.Ascorrectly submitted by Mr Howell, the Magistrate conflated the test for disqualificationonthe ground of apprehended bias,with that ofactualbias.First,his Honoursays in the context of dealing with the treatment of Mr Taylor in requiring him to hurrysending the documents to Rockinghamas opposed to allowingthe Prosecutiontime for Senior ConstableJordan to be located, his Honourasked, rhetorically:“Wouldthey form a view thatit was demonstrativeof a bias or an apprehension of bias,onmypart?I doubt it”.(Emphasis added).Second,inthejudgment his Honourdenied bullying Mr Pappas - which wasone ofthe accusations Mr Pappasrather volublymade-and denied that he sought to demean Mr Pappas,statingthat“my objective was to ensure thatthe trial proceeded in as orderly a way as it could, and that the defendant has a fair hearing”. His Honour thenmentioned the prolixcross-examination andnotedthata lot of questions were not the subject of objection but were probablyirrelevant questions.These are all reasonable observationsto make,but the issue is not the intention ofthe judicial officer, but howwhat he says and doesmight be perceivedby thefair-mindedlay observer, and that was not addressed.Third,his Honoursays:“…the combination of things said to result in me holding his legal team in contempt. I do not hold them in contempt”. Thesubjective position of the Magistrate is irrelevantto the determination of apprehension of bias. Inthe context of the personal tone of the attack made by Mr Pappas, thedirectresponsebyhis Honour to this particular accusationis understandable, butit adds to the impression,inthe way deployed here,that the focusof his Honour wason actual not apprehended bias.Fourth, laterin the judgmenthis Honoursaysthe followingin the context of discussing“robust exchanges”:“… well maybe I did raise my voice at times and maybe I was a bit intemperate in that regard butwoulda reasonable person observing the cut and thrust of the Local Court think that thatwasindicative of bias toward the defendant? I have indicatedno bias towards the defendant all in the proceedings.”(Emphasis added).This isclearlyanarticulationof the wrong test.The test is not“would”a reasonable person think this“was”indicative of bias;it is“might”afair-mindedpersonreasonablythinkhis Honour“might”notbringan objective mind tothe determination ofthe issues.Finally,hisHonour concluded that he does not think there is any reason why he should recuse himselfwithoutat any point in the judgmenteveraddressing the correct test.Mr Deardson behalf of the second defendantsubmitted that in the context of counsel’s submissions reflecting the language of actual bias,it was not unreasonable for the Magistrate to contextualise his response using that language. He was accused of“deliberately”taking a course,“unfairly makingorders”and that he had personal animus to Mr Pappas.He submitted that when the totality of reasons are considered, his Honour understood and appropriately considered the basis of the application.Mr Deards submitted that hisHonour was in effect in his reasons rejecting that there was any reasonable connection between the alleged state of mind he held, and an apprehension that he would not decide the case on its merits.This Court should make allowance the fact that this was anex temporedecision in a busy Local Court list with an extremely heavy workload,and read the reasons fairly, making due allowance for the circumstances and not to overly scrutinise them:Roylance v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)[2018] NSWSC 933at [13]per Bellew J. The application was also made without notice.MrDeardssubmitted that,properly constructedand read in totality, it is clear that the Magistrate applied the test inEbnerand decidedthe questionwith reference to what the fair-mindedlayobserver might think.Unfortunately, nowhere in his Honour’s decision does he articulate the correct test, andin atleast fourdifferent places,he articulated the testfor actual bias. Afair and beneficialreading of the judgmentas a wholecannotremedythat fundamental problem.Iacknowledgethatthe objective application of this particular testcan beachallengingtaskfor a presiding judicial officer toperform,particularlyduring the time pressuresof averybusylist in theLocal Courtandtheups and downs of a hearing. HisHonour hadanapparently inexperiencedpolice prosecutor, emotive subject matter,(allegations of racism and abusive conduct to a child),a young witness being cross-examined in an obtuse andrepetitivefashion,and rude, offensiveand truculent behaviour by defence counsel.However it is a task that must be done,and time must be taken to ensure it is done with focus on the appropriate test, and unfortunately hereitwas not.There was equanimity and patience extended to Sgt Smith at all times. Not so, Mr Pappas.Mr Howell’s submissions on this point are correct.Ground 3 of the summons is established and that ground of judicial review succeeds.Ground2- was the Magistrate in error in refusing to disqualify himself at the time of the judgmentGround 2 ofthe summonsraises the issue of whether atthisstage,his Honourshould have disqualified himselfon the ground ofapprehension of bias.Mr Howell submitted thatthe reasonable fair-minded lay observer mightconclude thatthe exchange set out at [63] and the suggestion that Mr Pappas would be“removed”from the Courtif he did not“move on”,was the result of Mr Pappas pursing anunmeritoriouscaseinan untrustworthy fashion that was so bad thatdespite being a barrister, heshould bephysicallyremoved from theCourt.There is a logical connection between that attitude(bythatstage clearlydemonstratedgiven the exchanges that had gone before)andthe possibility ofa feared deviation from deciding the case on its merits given the extreme nature of that threat.Mr Deards argued thatnothing complained ofroseabove“robust debate”,and that the terse tone was occasionally directed to both Mr Pappas and the police prosecutor and thefair-mindedlay observer would take that into account.In support of this submission, Mr Deards referred toGlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd v Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK)[2013] FCAFC 150:“[33] … It is well established that it is for the judge assigned to hear the matter to decide whether he or she should withdraw for apprehended bias. The test formulated by the High Court assumes that, in the first instance, it will be applied by the judge concerned: Dr Melissa A Perry,Disqualification of Judges: Practice and Procedure, Discussion Paper (Australian Institute of Judicial Administration, 2001) at [2.39]. As the plurality observed inEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy(2000) 205 CLR 337 at [74], “the ordinary, and the correct, practice” is for the judge to decide the matter for himself (or herself, as the case may be). ……[47] As inConcrete, the debate between bench and bar was robust and at times, the primary judge used emphatic language. But this would be readily understood by the fair-minded lay observer as part of the process ofunderstanding and testing counsel’s arguments with a view to reaching the right decision on the application before him as quickly as possible. The primary judge made that clear at various times during the exchange, for example at T44:4–6 (“I just want to articulate it to you so you can see where my mental block is coming from if I’m getting it wrong”) and T93:17 (“I’m trying to tease out with you so I can understand — make sure I understand your case as best my frail mind can, and understand Ms Howard’s case and work out what the answer I’ve got to give about it is”).”Those principles are no doubt correct,but“robust debate”is not what was occurring here. Therewasby this stagenot“testing of counsel’s arguments”,butadmonishments,insultsand threatsdirectedtoMr Pappas.Mr Deards also relied on this quote from Kenny J inVFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(2003) 131 FCR 102; [2003] FCA 872:“[81] Occasional displays of impatience and irritation, whether justified or not, will not amount to disqualifying bias. As Kirby J said inMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte AB(2000) 177 ALR 225 at 230:While sustained ill-temper can give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, momentary outbursts and misunderstandings in the often stressful world of adjudication must be tolerated, so long as they pass and do not affect the functions of the adjudicator:Galea v Galea(1990) 90 NSWLR 263 at 279-80, 283.As noted earlier, if a Member is sarcastic, mocking or rude, he or she fails to act in conformity with proper standards, but this conduct will not of itself constitute disqualifying bias. Mere insensitivity to an applicant, whether about his personal situation or otherwise, will also not amount to such error.”What occurred here wasby this stageunfortunatelymore in the nature of“sustained ill-temper”,rather than“momentary outbursts and misunderstandings”. Thefocus of the ill-temper was on Mr Pappas.It is not to the point to argue that Mr Pappas“gave as good as he got”. Mr Pappas’s behaviour was rude, defensive and obnoxious but the Magistrate has a deep-seated obligation to ensurethe outer signs ofimpartiality are exhibitedat all times, and to deal with the legal representatives for both sides in an even-handedfashion. Ifthere is a slipinto misunderstanding or outbursts of temper or annoyance,there is a need to ensure that they do not recur.In my view by that stage there was sufficient material, when considered cumulatively along the lines set out inGaudie, to satisfy the test that a fair-minded lay observer mightreasonablyconclude that the Magistrate might not bring an objective mind to the issues for determination.The fact that the Magistrate says he will be impartial,orthat I personally think he will be impartial,is not the test.Grounds 2 and 3 of the summons have been established,however I have proceeded to consider thetranscript of the submissions aboutbalance of the hearing, as requested by Mr Howell.It is appropriate that I consider whether there was any withdrawal, apology, improvement or re-balancing that occurred in the hearing after this stagethat could serve to correct or modify any perceptionsreasonablyheld by the fair-minded lay observer.As I have explained in the following part ofthis judgment, there was not.Refusal to allow adjournmentof the proceedings given indication of intention to file a summons in the Supreme CourtAfter judgment was delivered,Mr Pappas sought time to speak to his client.After the adjournment Mr Pappas advised the Court that he was instructed to commence proceedings in the Supreme Court to appeal the judgment.Thisexchangeensued:“PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour for that further indulgence. Your Honour, I have instructions on behalf of the defendant to seek by way of a summons in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to appeal your Honour's judgment in relation to the recusal application. In those circumstances and taking into account a couple of factors which I will just briefly sketch, the application is that these proceedings stand over pending the filing of a summons and the determination of that appeal. As your Honour will appreciate there is relatively little time left today.There may be as much as two hours available tomorrow afternoon. I imagine that hasn't changed very much but in the event that the appeal is successful, to proceed further today and more particularly tomorrow would effectively be otiose. It would simply engage court time, incur costs one way or another and cause, potentially at least, other witnesses to wait around needlessly. So, my application is simply that the matters be adjourned now. I'm happy to, if your Honour is concerned, give some indication of when the summons can and will be filed by, but I can assure your Honour it will be done in a timely fashion with the intention that the matter be listed as soon as convenient.HIS HONOUR: When's it going to be filed?PAPPAS: I'm sure it will be done by tomorrow, your Honour, but I haven't yetHIS HONOUR: By when tomorrow?PAPPAS: Well, I'm looking at Mr Taylor and he's not looking at me. 12 noon? 12 noon tomorrow, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I require evidence of that to be brought to my attention and I'll adjourn it until tomorrow. Do you want to be heard, Prosecutor?PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The sixth of the seventh 2023, noon.PAPPAS: At noon here, your Honour, sorry?HIS HONOUR: Noon here, and I expect that the summons will have been filed by that time, if not I will proceed. Thank you.PAPPAS: I just wonder if I can seek by way of clarification on that last order, or indication, does it follow that if it is filed in time and evidence is produced to your Honour, then the matter will be stood overHIS HONOUR: No, it doesn't follow, but I will consider it.PAPPAS: It seemed to that's all.HIS HONOUR: I will consider it then sir.PAPPAS: I'm sorry I'm simply seeking clarification.HIS HONOUR: Yes, well very good. I've given you the clarification. I will consider that then.PAPPAS: Yes, it's - no need to snap at me, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I'm not snapping at you sir; I'm just telling you that's what my view is. I will consider it then.PAPPAS: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO THURSDAY 6 JULY 2023 AT 12PM”[49]Mr Howell submitted thatthe Magistrate was intolerant of counsel’s inquiries as to what would happen if a summons was filed, leaving counsel in a state of uncertainty as to what would occur the following day. This was discourteous, particularly against the background of what had gone on that day, but not particularly so when his Honour made it clear he would consider the position once the summons was provided.6July 2023-third day of hearingThe third day commenced at12:40pmwithan application for an adjournment of the proceedingsmade by Mr Pappason the basis that proceedings had been filed in the Supreme Court.Sgt Smithopposed the adjournment. The Magistrate refused the application with reasons. No complaint is made about this. The matter then proceeded withthecontinuation of thecross-examination of theInformant.The very first question was objected to:“Q.Ms [REDACTED],would you agree that since 8 March 2022 you have given an account of what you say happened at the International Women’s Day event between you and Prof Heywood to a number of people?PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: Why the objection?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, it’s very general in, “A number of people.”HIS HONOUR: What do you want to say, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: It’s not an offensive question or a disallowable question in any way.HIS HONOUR: I’ll allow the question.”[50]At1:00pm,Mr Pappas interrupted his cross-examination toenquire as to whether there would be a break:“PAPPAS: Is that a convenient time, your Honour?HIS HONOUR: No. Just keep going.PAPPAS: I beg your pardon. I was hoping--HIS HONOUR: There will be no break. Keep going.PAPPAS: I was hoping I might get to go to the bathroom. That was all, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You can do that if you like, sir, but there will be no other break. Please do so.PAPPAS: I don’t wish to leave if your Honour is not going to leave the Bench.HIS HONOUR: Please do so. I will sit here. You can go to the bathroom, sir.PAPPAS: Very well. Thank you.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.SHORT ADJOURNMENTPAPPAS: Thank you for that indulgence, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Not a problem.PAPPAS: Before I continue can I inquire of your Honour whether your Honour proposes to allow any break for sustenance between now and 4?HIS HONOUR: Between now and however long I sit. I'm sitting beyond 4. The answer to your question is maybe.”[51]After this proposalwas communicatedby the Magistrate,Mr Pappas raised other issues regarding sitting times:“PAPPAS: Sitting beyond 4 causes some difficulty, of course. We had anticipated--HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas. I run this Court.PAPPAS: I understand that, your Honour, but would your Honour--HIS HONOUR: I’ll give a 20-minute break sometime this afternoon and that will be it. Thank you. Keep going.PAPPAS: Would your Honour allow me to address you? I mean we’re really falling back into this pattern that I complained about yesterday.HIS HONOUR: What is it you want to say, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: Two things, your Honour, if I may.HIS HONOUR: Yes.PAPPAS: Firstly, I, as an experienced legal practitioner, and indeed the people at the defence end of the Bar table reasonably anticipated that this Court would sit within what would be regarded as normal court hours. We have prebooked and paid for our flights back to the ACT and Sydney respectively. Mr Howell and I both have professional commitments tomorrow, not unreasonably expecting that we would get out of here on the flight that we’re booked on. Number 2, we would normally anticipate some sort of a break for a lunch and refreshment.HIS HONOUR: As I say, I contemplate a 20-minute break. Please proceed.PAPPAS: I haven't finished yet, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What else do you want to say?PAPPAS: Why did your Honour shake your head and look so--HIS HONOUR: I'm just saying, what else do you want to say?PAPPAS: Well, I'm about to get to it. I had anticipated that the documents I've called for which have been sought in writing for weeks would be produced over the luncheon adjournment. I don’t wish to be cross-examining this witness with potentially some important information not known to me.HIS HONOUR: Fair enough. When the document is produced I will give you a break.PAPPAS: Very well. Thank you.HIS HONOUR: Please proceed.PAPPAS: Thank you.”[52]Mr Howell submitted that this exchange had the effect of humiliating counsel,requiring him to go to the toilet while being“watched”and“monitored”by the Court. This is a ratherfeverishtake on events,but the subsequent refusalto adviseif and when there would be a breakforlunchwas discourteous and discombobulating forall legal representatives.It had the potential to curtail cross-examination due tounexpectedtimeframes, timepressures,and uncertainties createdby thisunheraldedchange to the usualcourtsitting hours.The cross-examination proceededponderously.Sometime laterthere wasthis exchange between the Magistrate and Mr Pappasthat arose from another obtuse(although not objectionable)question to the child complainant:“PAPPAS:Q. Let me go back to the questions I asked you about the use of inverted commas and your understanding of the significance of that, and the question I now ask you is whether at all times after 17 March 2022 you have treated written expressions of language encompassed within inverted commas in thatway with that understanding that it was the precise words being recorded.A. I don't know.Q. Should his Honour understand that on your oath you say, \"Well, I had that understanding of what inverted commas were all about\"?PROSECUTOR: Objection.PAPPAS: Please let me finish.HIS HONOUR: I'll hear the objection.PAPPAS: Could the connection be severed, please, your Honour?AUDIO VISUAL LINK DEACTIVATEDPROSECUTOR: Your Honour, he was making a statement and he was essentially putting words into this witness's mouth about what she just said.HIS HONOUR: In what way?PROSECUTOR: He was saying that what she meant by saying, \"I don't know,\" was what he was prefacing, that she under oath was saying to your Honour that what those words were, the recorded words in conversation, weren't as she said. So, he was turning those words that she just said around.HIS HONOUR: Explain that. What do you mean?PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, he was essentially making a statement, not a question, of what her answer would've been.HIS HONOUR: Mr Pappas, what did you want to ask her?PAPPAS: I need just to go back in order to answer your Honour’s question. Your Honour will recall that the witness had agreed with me following a compendious examination of the use of inverted commas that she had an understanding of what they were for. I then asked her whether within that framework of that understanding at all times after 17 March 2022 she had taken that approach to speech expressed within inverted commas. Her answer was, “I don't know,” and my question was - I never got to finish it, “Should his Honour understand thereby that you didn’t always follow that understanding?”HIS HONOUR: That's a fair question.PAPPAS: It is. Your Honour, can I, just before the link is re-established, renew an application I made to you on Tuesday, and that is the constant objections, many of which are without any proper foundation, coming from the Sergeant has the effect of truncating and making my cross-examination of this witness extremely artificial. It provides a significant break between questions. I've asked that the link be severed on a couple of occasions because frankly when the witness has heard exchanges the answer that then comes is not infrequently a reflection of what's been said. It’s just making the cross examination artificial, and it is not affording the defence a proper chance of testing this witness’s evidence in my respectful submission. I've got no trouble whatsoever with the objections that are proper and timely. I hadn't even finished this question when the Sergeant leapt to her feet. I had got as far as, “Should his Honour understand.”HIS HONOUR: Put the question.PAPPAS: Would your Honour indicate whether you--HIS HONOUR: I’ll think about what you say, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Put the question.”[53]Mr Howell submitted that there were furthernon-meritoriousobjections and then thisexchange occurred:“Q.You say on your oath, do you, that you’ve got absolutely no memory of how you related these events to your father?PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: Not what she said, Mr Pappas. Rephrase the question.PAPPAS: Can I be heard, please, your Honour?HIS HONOUR: You can be heard but that’s not what she said.PAPPAS: Your Honour, with great respect, I am not obliged to put verbatim back to the witness precisely what she said provided I put back to her a proper representation of the evidence she has just given. I have asked her now at some length whether she could recall the circumstances of speaking to her parents, whether one or both were present. I've asked her whether her father asked questions; she said she didn’t recall. I've asked her whether she simply started at the start and went to the end and related a narrative to her father. Again, I think the answer is, “I don't recall.” It’s not unfair to put to her that in those circumstances it appears she has no recall at all of how this complaint, if I want to call it that, was made to her parents. That’s a matter that goes fairly and squarely to this witness’s credit and to her reliability with respect and there's nothing at all wrong with the question I've asked.HIS HONOUR: I don’t have any issue with the last part of what you said. It does go to credit, and it goes to reliability. But what is it you're going to ask her?PAPPAS: The very question I've just asked her. Does she say, having regard to the various questions I've asked, that she has no recall at all about the circumstances in which she related this complaint to her parents?HIS HONOUR: Okay. You can ask the question.PAPPAS: I thought I had, your Honour. That’s the problem with these objections.HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon, sir. Ask the question of the witness.”[54]His Honour adjourned at 2:00pm for half an hour.At 2:35pm Mr Pappas raisedanissue in respect of documents he hadonly recently been givenwhich hesaid that heneeded to review before he could further cross-examinetheInformant. He also raisedmatters regardingtravel arrangements for his team:“PAPPAS: 2.35pm and it’s now 2.36pm, a copy of the outstanding COPS entry. I haven't looked to see how many pages it is in total because it’s not sequentially numbered but it appears to be about 20-odd pages of material. On a quick perusal of it some of it may be relevant but I've not had an opportunity to read it, neither have I had an opportunity to discuss it with my instructing solicitor or with my junior counsel as to how, so I’d seek some moments, perhaps not a long time but some moments to look at that.HIS HONOUR: Yes.PAPPAS: The other matters are more administrative than that. I know of course I've already alerted your Honour in general terms to the difficulties in sitting on this afternoon beyond what might be thought the usual court hours and I've indicated to your Honour that all three legal practitioners at the defence end of the Bar table are booked on the same flight out of Armidale at 4.55pm this evening. What I didn’t know, and I now indicate to your Honour is this. My instructing solicitor, Mr Taylor, has not only a flight from here to Sydney this afternoon but a flight from Sydney to Perth where he has an office. He is due to meet his wife in Perth and he understands, through correspondence with his wife, that their children who are travelling with her are both sick. I don't know more about that illness at this stage but obviously in those circumstances he would be very concerned to make the connection from Sydney to Perth if at all possible this evening.My junior, Mr Howell, also has a wife and three children. He was expected home this evening and indeed to appear in the Court, and I haven't asked which court, Liverpool Local Court tomorrow in a matter that is listed for hearing. In those circumstances I renew the suggestion with great respect to your Honour that it would be appropriate to sit until the normal close of business to afford each of the legal practitioners including myself the opportunity of getting to the airport. I understand that takes about 15 minutes. We’re all prebooked on the flights so that we could in essence arrive at the airport at the last moment so that we can meet our normal professional and other obligations. There was never any suggestion made that the matter would somehow extend beyond what would be regarded as normal court hours and with great respect to your Honour to require more of the legal practitioners is simply unreasonable. The demands being placed upon the defence team are, in a broad sense, unreasonable and I ask your Honour to reconsider the position which you rehearsed with me earlier.HIS HONOUR: Which was what?PAPPAS: Which was, as I understand it, your Honour will sit on beyond the normal court hours to some--HIS HONOUR: Yes. I probably will. Yes.PAPPAS: --to some unspecified time.HIS HONOUR: Yes.PAPPAS: Is your Honour not prepared—HIS HONOUR: I think the practitioners, there's a flight tomorrow morning, there's a flight later tonight. It’s not my problem.PAPPAS: No. It’s not your Honour’s--HIS HONOUR: We've got a witness on-screen who’s two hours behind us. I propose to allow her to give her evidence until 3 o'clock her time which is 5 o'clock the time here. Thank you.PAPPAS: Your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas. I hear what you say.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Prosecutor, do you wish to be heard on this topic?PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.PAPPAS: Has your Honour had the opportunity now to consider your position in relation to the matter I raised with you earlier about repeated objections from the prosecution end of the Bar table?HIS HONOUR: I thought about it. Yes.PAPPAS: Does your Honour--HIS HONOUR: No. I don’t. I thought about it. I'm sure the prosecutor hears what you say.PAPPAS: Well, she's been hearing it since Tuesday, and it made not the--HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: No. Sorry, your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Why do you want always to over-speak to me?PAPPAS: No. I don’t, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas. I have thought about it.PAPPAS: Why does your Honour always cut me off like that?HIS HONOUR: I'm not.PAPPAS: You are.HIS HONOUR: I've thought about it. You're the cutting offer, sir.PAPPAS: All right.HIS HONOUR: With respect, you're the cutter offer. Just please resume your seat. Prosecutor, we need the witness on the screen.PAPPAS: Your Honour, I wish--HIS HONOUR: Thank you. I will consider it and if it’s appropriate I will say something to her. To date it has not been appropriate. Thank you, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.”[55](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted that this exchange shows a deliberate choice to leave counsel in a state of uncertainty as to when the hearing would adjourn for the day,knowing this affected Ms Heywood’s team and no one else. The hostilitytocounsel was palpable, and the refusal to raise withSgt Smiththe frequency of her non-meritorious objectionscontinued.Shortly after,this exchange occurred:“PAPPASQ.If you let the laughing out of any account of what you say happened on that day, can you think of any reason why you would do so?A.I was under a lot of emotional distress. I was going through a lot after I was racially assaulted at the event and so that could definitely be a factor.Q.Would you agree with the proposition that laughter combined with apparently hurtful words can indicate that the speaker of the words did not mean to wound or hurt but was meaning to do something different?PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: Yes. What do you want to say, Prosecutor?PROSECUTOR: That’s asking an opinion, a supposition. That’s not asking a question of--HIS HONOUR: Yes. I agree with that. Move on. I don’t allow that question.PAPPAS: Would your Honour hear me?HIS HONOUR: Yes. What do you want to say?PAPPAS: It’s not asking for an opinion. It’s asking for this witness’s understanding of the use of the English language, nothing more. Whether she has an understanding that sometimes an apparently hurtful expression accompanied by laughter might not be received or understood as a hurtful expression.HIS HONOUR: What do you want to say, Prosecutor?PROSECUTOR: That’s exactly what I'm saying, your Honour. She can’t say an opinionated response.HIS HONOUR: I don't know where it takes us anyway, Mr Pappas. What's the relevance of that question?PAPPAS: The relevance is, as the witness has said, her recollection is of laughter accompanying these words.HIS HONOUR: That’s her evidence. Yes.PAPPAS: I'm entitled, with respect, to explore whether her understanding of language at that time was such that perhaps she misunderstood what was being said and done on her own version, not accepting the version to be accurate but on her own version.HIS HONOUR: What's the question?PAPPAS: Now we’re back in that line of country, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon.PAPPAS: We’re back in the line of country about what I--HIS HONOUR: What is the question?PAPPAS: Your Honour, please, may I respond to you rather than be hectored with, “What is the question? What is the question?”HIS HONOUR: Yes.PAPPAS: Thank you. What happens continuously is that an objection is made, I have a debate of sorts with your Honour and then your Honour retorts, “What is the question?” It’s a very difficult way to proceed. I've not encountered it in many years of practice, ever.HIS HONOUR: Sure.PAPPAS: It seems to be unique to your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I'm just asking you what the question is. What is the question?PAPPAS: Sorry. I'm now leaning to my left to speak to my junior. It doesn’t help that your Honour then repeats, “What is the question?” In a demanding voice. I’ll withdraw the question, your Honour. I’ll ask it again. It’s so much easier.Q.Ms [REDACTED], was it your experience in March 2022 that sometimes apparently hurtful words spoken accompanied by laughter on the part of the speaker might be understood differently, that is not as hurtful words but as jocular words?PROSECUTOR: Objection, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: We've had the objection. I’ll allow the question. I asked him what the question was. He's now reiterated the question and I'm allowing the question to be asked.PAPPASQ.Ms [REDACTED],do you recall the question I've just asked you?A.Yes.Q.Was that your experience in about March 2022?A.No.”[56](Emphasis added).Further cross-examinationproceeded in an apparent attemptby Mr Pappasto obtain a different answer from theInformant. Sgt Smithobjectedand the Magistrate ruledon the objection:“Q.So, you could think of no circumstance in which someone might say something apparently hurtful but laugh at the same time, not meaning to be hurtful?PROSECUTOR: Objection, your Honour.AUDIO VISUAL LINK DEACTIVATEDHIS HONOUR: Why don’t you ask a clear question, Mr Pappas?PAPPAS: Yes. Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: It’s not clear at all what that question gets at.PAPPAS: Thank you.AUDIO VISUAL LINK ACTIVATEDQ.Ms [REDACTED],you understood in March 2022 that laughter very often accompanied someone playing a prank or telling a joke, that sort of thing, didn’t you?PROSECUTOR: Objection.HIS HONOUR: Why do you object to that?PROSECUTOR: We’re asking what she affiliates with a prank or a joke, that laughter is something that happens with a prank or a joke and that’s simply not true. It’s a misguided question.HIS HONOUR: He's just asking for her view.PROSECUTOR: Sorry?HIS HONOUR: He's just asking for her view. I think that’s a fair enough question. I can’t see where it takes us but ask the question, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Will your Honour hear me again about--HIS HONOUR: I'm allowing you to ask the question.PAPPAS: Yes. I understand that. I'm seeking to re-agitate with you the matter that your Honour has been thinking about.HIS HONOUR: I'm sure the prosecutor hears what you say.PAPPAS: That doesn’t have--HIS HONOUR: Please proceed, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: It doesn’t have any effect on the prosecutor, your Honour, without your Honour exercising the control that you have as the--HIS HONOUR: Prosecutor, do I need to tell you that questions that you object to should be based on reasonable grounds?PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour, and--HIS HONOUR: Thank you.PROSECUTOR: --all my objections are that way.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.”[57](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted that this was a“parody”of redirectingSgt Smithand would be seen as such by afair-mindedlay observer.He submitted that itwouldalsobe seen as encouragementto herto proceedas she had been doing.I do not accept that is the only way the exchange might be viewed,but I acceptafair-mindedlay observer mightreasonably seeitthat way.A short time later,objectionwas takentoanineptandconfusing line of questioning, but Mr Pappas launched another assault on Sgt Smith’s probity and skill and the Magistrate’scompetencein thewaythathe hadbeen presiding and controlling theproceedings:“Q.But, if I said, “You're a mop-headed idiot,” and I laughed as I said it or even after I said it, you wouldn’t necessarily regard it as insulting of him, would you?A.Sounds like you're bullying him.Q.But you wouldn’t necessarily regard it as a serious insult, would you?PROSECUTOR: Objection, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: She's answered the question.PROSECUTOR: She's answered that question.HIS HONOUR: She says she regards it as you bullying him. Please proceed.PAPPAS: Your Honour, I can’t continue with this cross-examination with the constant interruptions that I'm suffering and your Honour’s--HIS HONOUR: I have warned the prosecutor. She understands the position. She is prosecuting this case. She has her professional obligations. I can do no more than that. Please move on.PAPPAS: Well, there is more your Honour can do.HIS HONOUR: What can I do?PAPPAS: Your Honour has power under s 27 and 29 of the Evidence Act 1995 to control the conduct in the same way your Honour purports to control my conductin court, and I'm inviting your Honour to do so because we've now got to the point where this has gone on and on and on.HIS HONOUR: That’s quite so, sir. I agree. It’s going on and on and on.PAPPAS: Yes. I know what your Honour means by that, that--HIS HONOUR: Which is exactly how it has been. Yes.PAPPAS: --the subtext is, “Yes. Mr Pappas, it’s you that’s dragging it on and on and on.”HIS HONOUR: It’s quite possible.PAPPAS: That’s what your Honour is saying to me.HIS HONOUR: It’s quite possible.PAPPAS: I'm not ignorant of your Honour’s inference.HIS HONOUR: It’s quite possible.PAPPAS: Your Honour’s animosity towards me is palpable.HIS HONOUR: I have no animosity towards you.PAPPAS: Your Honour clearly does.HIS HONOUR: Come on.PAPPAS: Clearly does. I know your Honour wishes to deny that.HIS HONOUR: Mr Pappas, I don’t even know who you are. Please proceed, Mr Pappas.”[58](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted thathis Honour’sdisdainforcounsel is clear from the sarcastic comments:“That’s quite so,Sir. I agree. It’s going on and on”. The comment was snide, and implied counsel’s cross-examination was inappropriately long.In the context of asking for time to review the COPSmaterial produced at 2:35pmthat day,thefollowingexchangeoccurred, with the Magistrate deploying anoticeablyicy and sarcastic tone:“PAPPAS: … could we have a moment to look at that or a few moments to look at that COPS material?HIS HONOUR: Sure. You’ve got your taxis, have you?PAPPAS: Sorry, your Honour?HIS HONOUR: Are you booking taxis?PAPPAS: No. Not at all.HIS HONOUR: We’ll just bat on then. Thank you. I thought you were wanting to get away.PAPPAS: I do. Is your Honour saying that we can?[The words:“It’s unbelievable”aremutteredby Mr Pappasable to be heard on the audio file,but it is unclear whether this was able to be heard in Court]SHORT ADJOURNMENT.”[59](Emphasis added).Mr Howell submitted that thisbroadenedthe cynicismthathis Honour had displayed to Mr Pappas,to allthreeof Ms Heywood’s legal representatives.Mr Howellsubmitted that the comment was gratuitous, unfair and indicative of contempt for the honesty and professionalism of those legal representatives.I agreethat is an available interpretation of those commentsand one that a fair-minded lay observer may reasonably make.Afterashort adjournment, the following exchangeensued:“HIS HONOUR: Yes?PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour. Just for absolute certainty, your Honour referred, as you departed the Bench, the ordering of taxicabs. No such taxi cabs have been ordered because of your Honour’s earlier indication but--HIS HONOUR: I thought you said Mr Taylor had sick children.PAPPAS: Yes. And he will be departing shortly but Mr Howell and I are trying to rearrange our life to be here for as long as your Honour wants to sit. But I thought I should inquire because it seemed to be implied that someone at least would be permitted to depart.HIS HONOUR: If he's got sick children I can’t see any reason why I wouldn’t allow him to depart.PAPPAS: I’d asked your Honour to give that indication earlier and your Honour specifically did not.HIS HONOUR: I just gave it when I walked out just a minute ago, put the taxis--PAPPAS: No. Your Honour mumbled something as you walked out that left us all in doubt as to what was intended,HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Mr Pappas. Thank you, Mr Pappas.PAPPAS: Is it the situation that Mr Taylor has your Honour’s permission to withdraw?HIS HONOUR: Indeed.PAPPAS: Thank you. Yes. All right.HIS HONOUR: When are you leaving, Mr Taylor?PAPPAS: Mr Taylor will leave in time to get to the airport, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: But I need to address him before he leaves so when is he leaving?PAPPAS: I see. I didn’t quite understand that your Honour wished to address him.HIS HONOUR: I don’t need to address him. I just need to talk to him because I will inquire of you, Mr Taylor, through you, Mr Pappas, that you provide to this Court the availability of senior counsel, junior counsel and yourself for the rest of this year and through to 30 June next year so that I can set an adjournment date for these proceedings, and I require that you do that by close of business Monday.PAPPAS: Your Honour can make those directions through me. There is simply no--HIS HONOUR: Before he goes, Mr Pappas, he is your instructing solicitor--PAPPAS: No. Your Honour, seriously there is simply no reason why, apart from your Honour’s desire to intimidate Mr Taylor, that you would require him to stand up while you address him in that way.HIS HONOUR: Require him to stand up? I just said--PAPPAS: Your Honour did. It’s all very well to nod and smile and say that’s--HIS HONOUR: Mr Taylor, are you prepared to do what I have asked?PAPPAS: Your Honour, please address me.HIS HONOUR: I said through you.PAPPAS: No. Your Honour is looking directly at Mr Taylor.HIS HONOUR: Mr Pappas, would you ask your instructing solicitor--PAPPAS: It’ll be done.HIS HONOUR: --whether he's prepared to do that?PAPPAS: It’ll be done.HIS HONOUR: Thank you.PAPPAS: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: Close of business Monday.PAPPAS: Yes. That's fine. That can be done.HIS HONOUR: Mr Taylor, before you go, through you, Mr Pappas, would you ask him that he is to appear on-screen here, he can appear by way of AVL to fix this hearing date? Mr Pappas, through you Mr Taylor is to provide available dates for senior counsel, counsel and himself for the balance of this year and through 30 June 2024 by close of business on 10/7 and he is to appear by way of AVL on 14/7/2023 to fix a new hearing date.PAPPAS: At what time, your Honour, on that AVL appearance?HIS HONOUR: 9.30.PAPPAS: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: I’ll deal with this when I get to it but 9.30 is the usual day that Court starts, the time that Court starts.PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes?PAPPAS: Thank you, your Honour.”[60](Emphasis added).Thiswas,in my view,anexampleof Mr Pappas“picking a fight”with the Magistrate. Contrary to the submissionsMr Pappasmade, theMagistrate did not ask Mr Taylor to stand.Mr Taylor was leaving.It is not unusual for a judicial officer to look at a solicitor who is being asked, through counsel, to make certain arrangements. By this time Mr Pappas was, in my opinion, activelylooking for matters to complain about, but nevertheless, in end result,the nature of theexchangeaddedsomefuel to the perception that a fair-mindedlayobserver may have that the Magistrate considers the legal team to bedishonestand incompetent and the defence casepotentiallyaffected by thatdishonestyand incompetence, and so requiringdifferent andmore scrutiny than the prosecution case.Some nine pages of transcript later, the cross-examinationof theInformantwascompleted. Therewasno re-examinationand shewasexcused. Therewasthen a courteous exchange regarding available dates and proceedingswereadjourned to 14 July 2023 for the purposes of fixing a further hearing date.Decisionin respect of Ground 1The test for apprehended bias has been met. The conduct of the Magistrate after the refusal of the recusal application did not change. No comments were re-visited or retracted with the new day. There wasunfortunatelymore sarcasm and criticismdirected to Mr Pappas.With respect tohis Honour’s attitude and dealingswithMr Pappas, afair-mindedlay observer may have noted,(amongst other things), that the cumulative effect of his exchanges with theMagistrate suggested that his Honour held a dim view of Mr Pappas.Variouscomments suggested his Honour thought Mr Pappas to be incompetent, rude, discourteous and atime-waster. Whether this is an accurate viewfor his Honour tohold or not, his Honouron occasionbelittled, derided, hurried, harassed,“warned”and at one point threatened counselwith physical removal from theCourt.Bydaythree,afair-mindedlay observer mighthavethought theMagistrate was contemptuous of Mr Pappas.His Honoureffectively rebuffedconcerns raised by Mr Pappas during the hearing about theoverly zealousobjections being taken bySgt Smith. The wayMr Pappas chose tovoice his concernswasoffensive, superciliousand unprofessional, but the initialeven-handednessof the Magistrateevaporated and gave wayto sarcasm and belittling of Mr Pappas.Mr Howell submitted that thetotality of the issues that have arisen and theMagistrate’s conduct in this case to date, might lead a fair-minded lay observer to think that theMagistrate bore significant animus towardsMs Heywood’ssolicitor and counsel. I accept that submission.Ialsoaccept Mr Howell’s submission that thefact that theMagistrate’s hostility was directed towardsMs Heywood’slegal representatives and not her personally is not to the point: seeAdacotvSowle[2020] FamCAFC 215 at [102] (perStrickland, Ainslie-Wallace and Watts JJ).His conduct towardsMr Pappashas the appearance ofeitherunfairness in the exercise of power by him,or exhibiting a concern that counsel,andthereforehis client,wereworthy ofderisionand so submissionsmade by himand cross-examination of witnessesconducted by him wasnot worthy of consideration.Mr Howell submitted that bycontrast, afair-mindedlay observer might think his Honour held no animus whatsoever towardsSgt Smith,and in fact enjoyed a good working relationship with her.He affordedher“preferential treatment”(allowing her to re-mention a return of subpoena by simply walking intoCourt); discussed matters with her in the absence of the plaintiff’s legal representatives; did nothing to discourage her from taking what became a chronicle of unjustified (and at times inchoate) objections to questions asked by counsel in the course of the hearing; made no disparaging comments towards her performance as an advocate; imposed no arbitrary or unreasonable time limits on her; and at alltimes extended to her courtesy and respect in the manner in which he spoke to her.Whilst somewhat over-stated,I have concluded thatthislastsubmission has some fundamental truthand that attitudinal contrast wouldhave been noticed by a fair-minded lay observer.Mr Howell submitted that afair-minded lay observer might think that such apparent prejudice and partiality might lead theMagistrate to decide the case other than on its legal and factual merits.I agree.The logical connection between the matters identified,and the feared deviation from the course of decidingMs Heywood’scase on its merits ispresent here because of the cumulative effect ofthosefactorsI have gone overwhich wereonlyreinforced as the hearing proceeded.The perception of impartiality is the fundamental matter that the law in respect of apprehended bias protects. Here, thecumulative effect of what has occurred in this casesupports aconclusion that a fair-minded lay observermayreasonablyapprehend that given theMagistrate’s apparent animus, contempt and disdain forMs Heywood’scounsel,and to a lesser extent, her solicitor,hemightbeunable to put aside a mindset unfavourable toMs Heywoodto a degree compatible with the dispassionate resolution of the case against her.His Honour’s conduct as it developed over the three days of the hearing did nothing to dispel that impression. The remarks went well beyond case management,occasionalflares of ill-temper,misunderstandingsorredirection of counsel to relevant issues.I note the submissions of Mr Deards regarding discretionary matters. He submitted that if the relief sought in the summons is granted,the childInformantwill be required to giveevidenceagainandthere has been awaste ofcourttime and resources. He also referred to thegeneralundesirability offragmentingof criminal proceedings.I accept thoseconsiderationsare important and areof relevance andconcern,buttheyare not sufficient to persuade me that thereliefsought should not be granted.OrdersI make the following orders:Pursuant to s 69 of theSupreme Court Act 1970(NSW), an order is made in the nature of prohibition precluding Magistrate Mark Richardson from hearing the proceedingsPolice v Heywood.Submissions will be heard with respect to the costs of the proceedings.**********Heywood - Annexures (156076, pdf)Endnotes1.British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Laurie (2011) 242 CLR 283; [2011] HCA 2 at [133]; Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 170 CLR 70 at 87–88; [1990] HCA 31 (“Laws”)2.Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 73; [1994] HCA 30 (“Webb”); Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488; [2000] HCA 48 at [12] (“Johnson”); Grollo v Palmer (1995) 184 CLR 348 at 394; [1995] HCA 26; North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service Inc v Bradley (2004) 218 CLR 146; [2004] HCA 31 at [29]3.Re JRL; Ex parte CJL (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352 (“Re JRL”); [1986] HCA 39; Tarrant v R [2018] NSWCCA 21 at [12]4.Re JRL at 371; [1986] HCA 39; CNY17 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (2019) 94 ALJR 140; [2019] HCA 50 at [56] (“CNY”)5.Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 584–585; [1989] HCA 44 (“Vakauta”); CNY at [28]6.Kostov v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2020] NSWCA 94 at [32]7.Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 299; [1983] HCA 17 (“Livesey”)8.McGovern v Ku-Ring-Gai Council (2008) 72 NSWLR 504 at [110]; Day v Sanders [2015] NSWSC 173 at [94]; Stollery v Greyhound Racing Control Board (1972) 128 CLR 509 at 518–519; [1972] HCA 539.Rouvinetis v Knoll [2013] NSWCA 24 at [24]; S&M Motor Repairs Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 358 at 375–376 (“S&M”); Johnson at [53]10.Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337; [2000] HCA 63 at [7]–[8] (“Ebner”)11.British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Laurie (2011) 242 CLR 283; [2011] HCA 2 at [145] (“British American Tobacco”); Livesey at 29912.Concrete Pty Ltd v Paramatta Design & Developments Pty Ltd (2006) 229 CLR 577; [2006] HCA 55 at [4]; Almeida v Opportunity Equity Partners Ltd [2006] UKPC 44 at [103]13.IOOF Australia Trustees Ltd v Seas Sapfor Forests Pty Ltd (1999) 78 SASR 151; [1999] SASC 249 at [185]14.Webb at 7315.Laws at 8716.Webb at 73, fn 2517.Isbester v Knox City Council (2015) 255 CLR 135; [2015] HCA 20 at [23] (“Isbester”); CNY at [58]18.Isbester at [20]19.CNY at [21]20.Johnson at [13]21.Webb at 73–74; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 179 ALR 425; [2001] HCA 28 at [28]; Isbester at [23]22.S&M at 380–381; AB v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWCA 73 at [21]23.British American Tobacco at 309 and 33124.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 1.40.2-625.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 5.43 to p 8.2826.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 9.26 to p 10.2927.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 11.47 to p 12.1728.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 13.26 to p 14.1629.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 15.26-5030.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, not reproduced in transcript but heard on recording31.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 19.12 to p 20.3232.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 36.13-3833.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 37.22 to p 39.5034.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 40.1-2935.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 40.33-4136.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 41.44 to p 42.937.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 45.24 to p 46.938.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 53.1139.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 53.47 to p 55.2440.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 55.28 to p 56.4541.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 56.49 to p 58.2342.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 64.46 to p 65.4043.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 65.43 to p 66.2544.Tcpt, 4 July 2023, p 72.13 to p 74.4245.Tcpt, 5 July 2023, p 3.48 to p 5.1446.Tcpt, 5 July 2023, p 4.20 to p 5.247.Tcpt, 5 July 2023, p 5.4 -4648.Tcpt, 5 July 2023, p 11.37 to p 12.649.Tcpt, 5 July 2023, p 17.45 to p 19.950.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 10.18-3251.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 15.36 to p 16.1852.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 16.20 to p 17.2053.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 28.36 to p 29.2054.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 33.37 to p 34.2455.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 35.29 to p 37.4556.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 41.16 to p 44.2757.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 43.13 to p 44.2758.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 45.24 to p 46.3459.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 53.22-3660.Tcpt, 6 July 2023, p 53.25 to p 55.48Amendments26 August 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tTypographical error corrected in the heading \"Ground 3\".Par 99, line 1 - the word \"tense\" replaced with \"terse\".DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The plaintiff seeks a declaration that theAmendedPlan is invalid, that the decision to adopt it should be set aside, a declaration that the defendants are acting in contravention of s 10 of theKosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018(NSW)(“theKWHHAct”), and an injunction prohibiting the defendants from continuing with aerial horse culling operations in the KNP.The plaintiff also seeks an extension of time to commence the proceedings to 7 May 2024, being the date of the filing of the original summons.Ground 3 of the amended summons asserts that representations made by the second defendant, the Secretary of the Department,(“the Secretary”)tothe Minister, were misleading and contained a material error with the result that the Minister committed jurisdictional error in adopting theAmendedPlan. Ground 4 alleges that the Minister, when deciding to adopt theAmendedPlan,made an error of law in relation to the use of aerial shooting of wild horses as a control method and thereby committed jurisdictional error.Ground 5 alleges that the Minister, when deciding to adopt theAmendedPlan,acted in a legally unreasonable way in relation to the use of aerial shooting as a control method and thereby committed jurisdictional error.Ground 1 allegesthat both defendants are acting contrary to law in purporting to carry out and give effect to theAmendedPlan. This was said in the amended summons to amount to jurisdictional error, but that is no longer asserted. The essence of ground 1 is simply that the implementation of theAmendedPlan is contrary to law.In summary, the plaintiff says in relation to the grounds:Ground 3: The adoption of aerial shooting as a control method in the Amended Plan was based on incomplete and misleading advice from the Secretary as to the animal welfare issues arising in relation to aerial shooting. As aresultthe Minister’s decision to adopt the Amended Plan was infected by error.Grounds 4 and 5: The Minister’s decision toapprove in the Amended Plan aerial shooting in all part of the KNP lacked an evident or intelligible justificationin light ofthe known animal welfare risks arising in relation to aerial shooting and was therefore legally unreasonable.Ground 1: The methodof aerial shooting currently being deployed by the Secretary is inconsistent with the requirements of the Amended Plan, namely the requirements that any aerial shooting accord with national standard operating proceedings(sic), animal welfare assessments and animal welfare legislation.The amendments to theoriginal planPrior to October 2023, the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan(“the Plan”)adopted under theKWHH Actdid not permit the use of aerial shooting as a control method in relation to wild horses in the KNP.A Decision Brief was forwarded by the Secretary to the Ministeron or about 27 July 2023(“the First Decision Brief”). Its purpose was to make a direction to the Secretary to prepare a draft amendment to the Plan.TheFirstDecisionBrief informed the Minister thatthePlan,adopted on 24 November 2021,required the wild horse population to be reduced to 3,000 horses in 32% of theKNPby the end of June 2027. It said that on current estimates there were around 19,789 horses across 53% of theKNP. The horses were significantly impacting ecological,culturaland recreational values in the park.TheFirstDecisionBrief went on to say:Current control methods will not meet the requiredtargetThe current approved methods of control identified in the Plan include passive trapping followed byrehoming or sending to a knackery, ground shooting (including the option of killing horses in trap yards) and aerial or ground mustering.Analysis indicates that the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) must remove 5,960 horses every year (23,840 in total) to meet the statutory requirement to reduce the horse population to 3,000 horses by June 2027. However, it is estimated that the level of horses capable of being removed using existing control methods will, on average, be no more than 4,100 horses annually -i.e.1,860 horses per annum less than is required to meet the population target.Aerial shooting will enable the target and animal welfare requirements to bemetAerial shooting is both a highly effective means to rapidly reduce feral animal populations (including horses) and achieves higher animal welfare outcomes via a faster time to death and reduced stress to individual animals relative to other forms of control (which involve, for example, mustering, transport, killing in a knackery or shooting in trap yards).The welfare benefits of aerial shooting, when conducted according to best practice, are acknowledged in scientific and technical literature. Aerial shooting is routinely used for invasive species in NSW including deer and pigs. The Plan itself acknowledges the welfare benefits of aerial shooting, despite notauthorisingits use. A 2022 published evaluation of the Plan's implementation concludes that aerial shootingcan havegood animal welfare outcomes when conducted in accordance with best practice; and a national standard operating procedure for the aerial shooting of feral horses already exists.(emphasisadded)On 27 July 2023, the Minister directed the Secretary to prepare a draft amendment to the Plan that would adopt and approve aerial shooting as a control method.Following the Minister’s direction on 27 July 2023, a draft amended plan was prepared and exhibited for public comment between 8 August and11September2023. A total of 11,002 representations were received as part of the consultation. On or about 6 October 2023, theSecretaryprovided a Decision Brief(“theSecond Decision Brief”)to the Minister in relation to the Minister’sconsideration whetherto adopt the amendments to the Plan.TheSecondDecision Brief relevantly said:RecommendationThat you:•Notethe initial draft amending plan to make amendments to the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan 2021 that was exhibited for public comment under section 6 of the Act, and now provided to you in accordance with section 8(a) of the Act (Tab 1).•Notethat this briefing constitutes the representation on the initial draft amending plan by the appropriate delegate of the Secretary, as described in section 8(b) of the Act.•Considereither or both of the following:- The public representations received on the initial draft amending plan exhibited under section 6 of the Act, and now provided to you in accordance with section 8(c) of the Act (Tabs 2 to 2C), and/or- The summary of public representations received on the initial draft amending plan, now provided to you in accordance with section 8(d) of the Act (Tab 5).•Considerthe representation from the National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council under section 7 of the Act, and now provided to you in accordance with section 8(c) of the Act (Tab 3)•Notethat the Heritage Council of NSW determined not to make a representation under section 7 of the Act (Tab 4).•Considerthe advice of the Wild Horse Community Advisory Panel, including the dissenting advice from one panel member, provided in response to a request made under clause 4, Schedule 1 of the Act (Tab 6).•Notethat the exhibited initial draft amending plan (Tab 1) and final draft amending plan (Tab 13), were prepared having regard to requirements for the wild horse heritage management plan in section 5 of the Act, including by taking into account the object of the Act, the objects of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NPW Act), and the matters required to be considered under section 72AA of the NPW Act.•Considerthe potential environmental impacts of enabling aerial shooting to be used as an approved wild horse control method under the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan 2021, as set out in the Review of Environmental Factors (Tab 7).•Considerthe representation submitted by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee (Tab 8) and note that the Review of Environmental Factors includes consideration of the potential impacts of aerial shooting on Aboriginal cultural heritage (Tab 7).•Considerthe draft carcass management plan, which will be finalised and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General, Environment and Heritage Group should you decide to adopt the final draft amending plan (Tab 10).•Notea draft standard operating procedure has been developed for a preliminary program of aerial shooting of wild horses and will be finalised and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General, Environment and Heritage Group should you decide to adopt the final draft amending plan (Tab 12).•Notethat the annual population survey of wild horses commences 9 October 2023 and outcomes will be used to inform future operational decisions about the application of aerial shooting as a control method, should you decide to adopt the final draft amending plan.•Notethat a communications plan will be finalised and implemented to support public and stakeholder awareness of your decision on whether to adopt the final draft amending plan.•Notethat Department of Planning and Environment (DPE) Legal and NSW Crown Solicitor’s Office (CSO) has reviewed the final draft amending plan (Tab 13) and this brief.•Decidewhether to adopt the final draft amending plan to make amendments to the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan 2021, which will make aerial shooting an approved control method (and make other supporting amendments to the plan) (Tab 13).…Draft standard operating procedure for preliminary program has beenpreparedAn independent, expert review of current published scientific literature in August 2023 concludes that aerial shooting results in animal welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations (Tab 11). The review was provided to and publicly released as part of responses to questions on notice from the Senate Inquiry.If you decide to adopt the final draft amending plan, aerial shooting of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park would be carried out to the highest animal welfare standards. This will include the development of a standard operating procedure (SOP) informed by independent expert veterinary and animal welfare advice and involve ongoing auditing by animal welfare experts. The NPWS SOP would meet Australian and NSW legislative requirements.A draft SOP has been developed for a preliminary aerial shooting program in consultation with an independent wildlife veterinarian and RSPCA NSW (Tab 12). The draft SOP will be finalised and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General if the final amending plan is adopted. The SOP for the full operational program will then be developed and finalised based on outcomes of the preliminary program and independent animal welfare advice and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General.Once approved, the final SOP will be followed in all future wild horse aerial shooting programs in the park and remain under active, ongoing review.(emphasisadded)Tab 11 (referred to above) was a document entitled“Literature review on humaneness and effectiveness of aerial shooting of feral horses”(“the Literature Review”), written by ProfessorElissaCameron whois Professor of Wildlife Ecology at the University of Tasmania, and was a member of the Independent Technical Reference Group who have been advising on the issue of thewildhorses sinceat least2015.The Literature Reviewrelevantly said:OverviewAerial shooting, particularly from helicopters, is an effective tool for reducing wildlife abundance in inaccessible areas or on landscape scales. Public acceptability remains low, and relates to welfare concerns, exacerbated by a lack of information on animal welfare outcomes. The humaneness of aerial shooting was considered by the Independent Technical Reference Group in 2015, although at this stage aerial shooting was not considered one of the options. The goal of this review is to determine if the 2015 humaneness assessment is supported by any subsequent research.The literature supports that the keys to successful aerial operations depend on using highly skilled and experienced shooters and pilots, ensuring multiple shots ('overkill'), and shooting in relatively open areas. When skilled operators work in open areas with multiple shots to each animal, the outcomes for animals are humane, with very short time to insensibility (<1 minute), with more than half insensible on the first shot and very low percentages of wounding (<1%).Aerial shooting therefore results in welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations.Furthermore, aerial shooting involves a single procedure, so cumulative impacts do not need to be considered, but do need to be considered in other control methods. Lastly, aerial shooting can reduce numbers to an extent that research suggests is required to have positive impacts on conservation.Due to the public concerns, the practices should be openly audited and made publicly available to ensure best practice is employed, and that there is continual improvement, with animal welfare outcomes prioritised in every management action. However, the decision of technique should be based on the achievement of the management objective and the welfare outcomes. Community perception of welfare outcomes should not drive thedecisions, butshould be considered where there could be a reputational risk effecting (sic)the licence to operate.In summary, both desktop and published field humaneness assessments conclude that best practice aerial shooting results in humaneness that are comparable or better than other forms of control, with ground shooting having similar outcomes. Furthermore, aerial shooting is a technique that has the potential to removesufficient numbersto impact the desired conservation outcomes on the National Park. The literature therefore supports the conclusion that aerial shooting could be a humane and effective management tool.…Aerial shooting assessmentAerial shooting involves a qualified shooter using a high calibre semi-automatic weapon from a helicopter, with shooting including deliberate repeat shooting. There is a standard operating procedure in Australia (Sharp 2011). Generally, helicopter-based shooting is effective for population reduction (Bengsenet al. 2022). While aerial shooting has been used on a large number of species and is efficient for reducing population size (e.g.feral donkeys Carrion et al. 2007; feral pigs Parkes et al. 2010; red deer Forsyth et al. 2013; sika deer Forsyth et al. 2013, Latham et al. 2018, fallow deerBengsenet al. 2022; chitalBengsenet al. 2022), fewer studies have assessed welfare outcomes.To assess welfare, all the different sections of the procedure need to be considered, including the helicopter pursuit, the mode of death, time to death and rate of non-lethal injury and associated suffering. Furthermore, logistic challenges also need to be considered, as aerial shooting is inherently imprecise, since a moving platform is used to shoot a moving target (Hampton et al. 2014), such that these logistic considerations can have welfare implications. Some logistic techniques may both enhance efficacy and welfare outcomes, such as thermal camera assisted aerial shooting (Puisfordet al. 2022, Cox et al. 2023). Vegetation is an important consideration, as closed canopy makes both detection and follow-up shots more difficult and time consuming, potentially increasing the time from detection to insensibility. Initial studies had an outcome focus. For example, English (2000) assessed the welfare outcomes of the 606 horses shot in an operation in Guy Fawkes National Park, which led to widespread claims of inhumane treatment, but found no evidence of negative welfare outcomes.A growing number of studies have performed a welfare assessment on aerial shooting operations, including both pre-mortem and post-mortem inspections, which are required for a full assessment of welfare outcomes (Hampton et al 2016b). The overall conclusion from these initial studies is that the time to death or insensibility (because death can be hard to judge from a helicopter, Hampton et al. 2022), is short, including if the chase is included in the calculation. For horses specifically there has been one study, but it assessed the welfare outcomes across three control operations and almost 1000 horses (Hampton et al. 2017). The welfare outcomes are very similar to another open country species, the dromedary camel (Hampton et al. 2014). While some parameters were sub-optimal (37% were not rendered immediately insensible; 3% of horses were shot outside of preferred anatomical target zones), this was explained by shooter skill which is emphasised as an important consideration. However, the time to insensibility was quick, and the non-fatal wounding rate was <1%. High shooter skill and experience is associated with better welfare outcomes in horses (Hampton et al. 2017) and other species (Hampton et al. 2014). Other shot related factors, such as projectile energy, shot type and vegetation cover can also affect outcomes (Table 4).(emphasisadded)The Literature Review then set out a table prepared froma number ofstudies of aerial shooting of a variety of wild animals. The table provided information about what percentage of the animals were rendered instantly insensible and factors which might have informed those percentages. The Literature Review then said:Based on literature currently available, aerial shooting in horses has involved chases of <1 minute, and time to insensibility averaging 15s, with 63% rendered insensible instantly. Thus, the evidence to date in horses suggests that the welfare impact approximatesScenario 1(best practice, chase <1minute, first shot cranium, rendered almost instantly insensible), rather thanScenario 2(extended chase >5 minutes, wounding, regaining consciousness before death). However, for a minority of individuals, chase time was ~10 minutes, so closer toScenario 2(Hampton et al. 2017). Evidence from other species supports the conclusion that welfare outcomes more closely match Scenario A (sic)in open country species like camels. Outcomes for most other species are also closer to Scenario A(sic), even in woody country – provided best practice is applied (such as fly-back with multiple shots, high projectile energy, or thermal cameras in bush), although there is a growing probability that some individuals have welfare outcomes closer to Scenario B(sic).Overall, therefore, there is evidence that welfare outcomes are moderate with a duration of minutes, resulting in a score of 4 for Part A (i.e. less impact than most other management techniques for Part A), and an A score for Part B, representing a very rapid time to insensibility from first shot, and low impact (equivalent to the low-impact lethal techniques, like humane on-site killing, and best practice ground shooting).Therefore, the evidence to date suggests that best practice aerial shooting would lead to equivalent welfare outcomes to other forms of lethal control, and better outcomes then several of the current techniques.When assessing welfare outcomes, the goals of the operation must also be considered. The goal of removing horses is to reduce impact on the land and the remaining species. If the horses removed do not have the desired positive outcome for the land values and other species, then the welfare impacts are not justified. For example, if the number of horses removed is equivalent to annual recruitment, then the population size and associated impacts on the natural values will remain constant, and the goals of the operation will not have been met. One could therefore argue that the welfare impacts on the horses removed was poorly justified if there is no positive impact on the land values and remaining species, which provided the justification for the management action. Thus, aerial shooting can removesufficient numbersto positively impact conservation, providing better justification for the welfare impacts. While public acceptability of aerial shooting remains problematic, the choice of management techniques should be based on actual (not perceived) animal welfare outcomes and the effectiveness of the technique to reach the desired conservation outcome (Hampton et al. 2016b).(emphasisadded)Amongst other thingsthatwere contained in theSecondDecision Brief were the matters required to be provided to the Minister pursuant to s 8 of theKWHHAct, being (a) the draft plan, (b) any representation on the draft plan by theSecretary, (c) any representations received under section 6 or 7, and (d) a summary of any representations received under section 6.In the part of theSecondDecision Brief entitled“Summary of Representations”, the Secretaryinformed the Minister that a total of 11,002 representations were received. They were contained in a USB attached to the Brief.The Brief said:This report summarises the representations received during public exhibition on each proposed amendment and outline recommendations in response.In relation to Amendment 5.2 (Aerial Shooting) the following appeared:This amendment proposed to include aerial shooting in the list of control methods available for use in controlling wild horses in the park (section 6.2 of the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan). Feedback on Amendment 5.2 is summarised in Table 5 below.87% of all submissions provided feedback on Amendment 5.2. Of these, 82% expressed support for aerial shooting as a control method and 18% expressed opposition.The most frequently raised points in opposition to Amendment 5.2 were:•concerns about impacts on animal welfare (73%)•accuracy of wild horse population estimates (36%)•adequacy of existing control methods to achieve the plans objectives (8%)•environmental impact of carcases left in situ (6%)•emotional impact on people (5%)•ineffectiveness as a control method (5%)The most frequently raised points in support of Amendment 5.2 were:•inadequacy of existing control methods (88%)•acceptability of animal welfare outcomes (83%)•accuracy of population estimates (78%)•safety (73%)Table 5What points were raised in the representation?RecommendationsWild horse welfareAnimal welfare outcomes are not acceptable.Representations expressed opposition to this amendment on the basis that it will have a significant and unacceptable impact on the welfare of wild horses.Concerns about aerial shooting included:•aerial shooting cannot be sufficiently accurate to guarantee an instantdeath•it is not possible to check every horse to ensure shooting has beeneffective•shooting may separate foals frommares and disrupt herdstructureNo change to draft amending plan.Evidence to date suggests that best practice aerial shooting would lead to equivalent welfare outcomes to other forms of lethal control, and better outcomes then several of the current techniques.The literature supports that the keys to successful aerial operations depend on using highly skilled and experienced shooters and pilots, ensuring multiple shots (‘overkill’), and shooting in relatively openareas. When skilled operators work in open areas with multiple shots to each animal, the outcomes for animals are consistent with the highest animal welfare standards. Aerial shooting results in welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations.If aerial shooting is approved and subsequently used as a control method, NPWS will achieve the highest animal welfare standards consistent with relevant Commonwealth and/or NSW animal welfare legislation,regulationsand codes of practice through adherence to a rigorous and comprehensive NPWS standard operating procedure.The procedure will be developed by NPWS with independent expert veterinary and animal welfare advice. Compliance with the procedure will be subject to regular auditing by animal welfare experts.Animal welfare outcomes are acceptable.Representations expressed support for the amendment on the basis that the animal welfare outcomes are acceptable.Representations highlighted that this method has been used effectively to control numerous feral animal species.No change to draft amending plan.Points raised in support were consistent with the draft amending plan.On23 October 2023 the Minister decided to adopt theAmendedPlan.The Amended PlanThe Amended Plan relevantly provided:Once this plan is adopted, it must be carried out and given effect. The plan will prevail if there is any inconsistency with theKosciuszko National Park Plan of Management 2006(Department of Environment and Conservation NSW 2006).…6. Control methodsControl methods will be selected for use based on maximising animal welfare outcomes (section 6.1), control effectiveness andtaking into accountmanagement variables specific to the area. Staff,contractorand public safety during control operations is also a critical factor in identifying appropriate control methods. Management variables such as terrain, accessibility, weather and wild horse demographics, effectiveness,efficiencyand cost also need to be considered (Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel 2020).Both lethal and non-lethal control methods will be required to achieve the plan’s targets. AH approved control methods will be available for use on all wild horses across the park.Capture and control methods that are available for use in the park are outlined below.6.1Environmental assessment of control methodsThe control methods in section 6.2 of the plan may include actions that are considered ‘activities' for the purposes of Part 5 of the EP&A Act.In order tomeet the environmental impact assessment requirements for ‘activities’ under the EP&A Act, all matters affecting or likely to affect the environment by reason of the relevant control methods have been examined and taken into account before the final plan was adopted under section 9 of the Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act.Further assessment of environmental impacts will be undertaken to comply with the EP&A Act before the implementation of relevant control actions in the park or parts of the park.6.2Animal welfareEnsuring optimal animal welfare outcomes is a key priority for the management of wild horses in the park. All control methods will be implemented consistent with relevant Commonwealth and/or NSW animal welfare legislation, regulations, codes of practice and standard operating procedures. Currently, these include but are not limited to:Commonwealth•Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines: Land transport of livestock(AHA 2012)•Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals - Feral Livestock Animals: Destruction or capture,handlingand marketing(SCAAHC 2002)•Model Code of Practice Humane Control of Feral Horses(Sharp & Saunders 2014) and associated standard operating procedures:-HOR001 - Ground shooting of feral horses(Sharp 2011a)-HOR002 - Aerial shooting of feral horses(Sharp 2011d)-HOR003 - Mustering of feral horses(Sharp 2011b)-HOR004 - Trapping of feral horses(Sharp 2011c)-GEN 001 - Methods of euthanasia(Sharp 2013)New South Wales•Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979•Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Regulations 2012•Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Land Transport of Livestock) Standards (NSW Government 2013)•Welfare scoring nutritionally deprived beef cattle, dairy cattle and their crosses,sheepand horses(NSW Department of Primary Industries 2013)For those control methods where an Australian or state standard operating procedure, standard or guideline exists, an animal welfare assessment of the method was completed by the Kosciuszko Wild Horse Independent Technical Reference Group (ITRG) (2015) and reviewed by the Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel (2020). The assessments were undertaken using theModel for Assessing the Relative Humaneness of Pest Animal Control Methods(Sharp and Saunders 2011).For some control methods, such as euthanasia via lethal injection, an Australian or state standard operating procedure has not yet been developed. In these cases, a standard operating procedure will be developed, and an animal welfare assessment completed before the control method is used (Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel 2020).The following actions will be undertaken for each control method available for use on wild horses in the park:1.Develop standard operating procedures that are tailored for use in the park.The standard operating procedures will be consistent with national and/or state procedures where available. Standard operating procedures will be developed following engagement with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and relevant specialists as required. Standard operating procedures will be approved by the Deputy Secretary of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).2.Animal welfare assessments will be undertakenfor those methods where a national or state standard operating procedure is not currently available before the method is used in the park.3.Annual review of standard operating proceduresto update and adjust control methods based on best practice approaches to animal welfare and the outcomes of any animal welfare assessments undertaken during use of the control method.Implementation of control methods will be undertaken with consideration of the following variables to ensure welfare outcomes are optimised:•skilled personnel (Hampton et al. 2017; Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel 2020)•strict adherence to procedures (Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel 2020)•minimising cumulative welfare impacts inherent in multi-staged methods (Kosciuszko Wild Horse Scientific Advisory Panel 2020; ITRG 2015).Grounds of appealIt is convenient to deal with the grounds in the order they were argued.Ground 3Ground 3 said this:3.The representations made by the Second Defendant to the First Defendant pursuant to Section 8(d) of theKosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018(NSW) were misleading and/or contained a material error with the result that the Minister committed jurisdictional error in adopting the Plan.a.The summary of representations made by the Second Defendant stated that evidence suggested that best practice aerial shooting would lead to equivalent welfare outcomes to other forms of lethal control, and better outcomes than several of the current techniques.b.The summary of representations made by the Second Defendant stated that aerial shooting results in welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations.c.The representations made in particulars (a) and (b) above were misleading, incorrect, made in the absence of evidence and/or legally unreasonable.d.The representations made constituted a mandatory relevant consideration for the Minister pursuant to Section 8(d) of theKosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018(NSW).e.It is to be inferred that the Minister considered the representations in adopting the Plan.f.In light ofthe errors in the representations, the Minister committed jurisdictional error in adopting the Plan.The plaintiff accepted that, for it to succeed, it had to establish three propositions. First, the issue of animal welfare implications of aerial shooting is central to the question of whether to adoptaerial shooting as a control method, and the Minister was legally obliged to consider that matter. Secondly, the summaries provided to theMinister on that topic were obviously incomplete and did not provide a fair account of the relevant information with the result that theMinister made a legal error in making the decision. Thirdly, the incomplete and misleading summaries were not immaterial on the basis that the minister can be taken to have read and considered some further underlying material in the brief.It became clear during the course of argument that, although the ground made reference to the representations and the summary of representationspursuant to s 8(d) of theKWHHActbeing misleading or containing material error, the ground was actually concerned with the summary provided by theSecretaryto theMinisterand the recommendations made by theSecretaryin response to the summary of representations recordedpursuant to s 8(b).SubmissionsThe plaintiff pointed to s 4 of theKWHHAct which provides:Object of ActThe object of this Act is to recognise the heritage value of sustainable wild horse populations within parts of Kosciuszko National Park and to protect that heritage.The plaintiff submitted that inherent in the concept of protecting the heritage value of wild horses is the necessity to considerwhether or notthey should be shot and, if they are, whether that will cause them unnecessary pain and suffering. The plaintiff drew attention to theSecondReading speech in respect of the bill which became the KWHHAct in 2018 to support the notion that animal welfare implications were involved in the concept of protecting their heritage.The plaintiff submitted that what was contained in the Amended Plan at 6.2 (see[20] above), particularly the references to legislation and codes concerned with prevention of cruelty to animals, demonstrates the centrality of animal welfare concerns.The plaintiff submitted that all the Minister was told about animal welfare in the body of the Brief was the italicised paragraph set out at [13] above, reproduced here:An independent, expert review of current published scientific literature in August 2023 concludes that aerial shooting results in animal welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations (Tab 11). The review was provided to and publicly released as part of responses to questions on notice from the Senate Inquiry.The plaintiff submitted that this summary was not accurate,completeor fair.The plaintiff submitted that a comparison between the summaries provided to the Minister and the Literature Review, and the reasoning on which the Literature Review was based, demonstrates that the summaries did not give a fair account of the underlying material to the Minister for the following reasons.First the summaries presented aerial shooting as a control method that resulted in equivalent or better animal welfare outcomes than other control methods as a general proposition, without qualification or condition.On the other hand, the conclusions reached in the Literature Review were madeon the basis ofmaterial that was highly contingent and qualified.There was only one survey of aerial shooting of wild horses, and that was conducted in 2017. It was known as the 2017 Hampton Survey. This survey involved“head shooting”only, it involved 37% of horses not being rendered immediately insensible, it occurred in a flat, arid and environmentwith few treesin Central Australia, and involved chase times of less than one minute.Although the author of the Literature Review relied on the work of the ITRG in relation to animal welfare outcomes of aerial shooting in 2015, itsfindings of acceptable animal welfare outcomes were what is termed“Scenario 1”,(where horses are chased for less than one minute, are rendered insensible with the first shot, and do not recover consciousness prior to death). The ITRG also concluded that aerial shooting should only occur in open areas with minimum high canopy vegetation. The plaintiff submitted that none of thesequalifications in the 2017 Hampton Survey and the ITRG 2015 were explained to the Minister in the relevant summaries, yet they were critical.Secondly, the plaintiff submitted that summaries provided to the Minister suggested that some change had occurred in the scientific literature in relationto animal welfare outcomes of aerial shooting since the plan was first adopted, such that the Minister could be satisfied that aerial shooting led to the best animal welfare outcomes. However, the plaintiff submitted that the critical material relied on in the Literature Review was not new or even recent. The 2015 report of the ITRGhad been available for eight years and had only concluded that best practice aerial shooting“can have”thelowest negative animal welfare impact of all lethal control methods. Further, a report of theScientificAdvisoryPanel in 2020 had considered the 2017 Hampton Survey and said that it provided“insufficient evidence”to reachafirm conclusion about the animal welfare impacts of aerial shooting. That information was not conveyed to the Minister.Thirdly, the plaintiff submitted that the goal of the Literature Reviewwas stated to be“to determine if the 2015 humanness assessment is supported by any subsequent research”. However, the plaintiff submitted that nowhere was the Minister told this or told of theparticular conditionsby which the ITRG considered that aerial shooting could led to acceptable animal welfare outcomes.Fourthly, the plaintiff submitted that the author of the Literature Review expressly accepted that for a“minority”of horses subject to aerial shooting, animal welfare impacts would be closer to“Scenario 2”in the ITRGassessment(extended chase greater than five minutes, wounding, regaining consciousness before death). That was also not brought to the attention of the Minister.The plaintiff submitted that there is nothing to suggest that the Minister read or otherwise considered the Literature Review itself rather than the summaries of it provided by the Secretary.The secondDecisionBrief expressly requested the Minister to consider certain tabs of which Tab 11 (the Literature Review) was not one.Thedefendantssubmitted that theKWHHAct places no limitation on the control methods that can be authorised in a plan and makes no reference to animal welfare, either in relation to the making of a plan or amending a plan. TheMinister was not required by the legislation to consider whether a control method was humane or had the lowest animal welfare impact.Thedefendantscriticised the reliance by the plaintiff on two isolated passages in the recommendations in response to the representation made about animal welfare outcomes. Thedefendantssubmitted that the passageas a whole drewthe Minister’s attention to the Literature Review and the evidence that successfulaerial operations depend on using highly skilled and experienced shooters and pilots, the use of multiple shoots, shooting in relatively open areas and the application of welfare standards consistent with Commonwealth and NSW animal welfare legislation, regulations and codes of practice. Further, thedefendantssubmittedthatthe recommendationsas a whole remindedthe Minister that if aerial shooting was approved and used, National Parks and Wildlife Service would develop a standard operating procedure with independent expert veterinary and animal welfare advice which would be audited regularly by animal welfare experts.Thedefendantssubmitted that the plaintiff acknowledged that the conclusions reached in the Literature Review were that aerial shooting led to appropriate animal welfare outcomesin some conditions but not in others. Thedefendantssubmitted that nothing in the material briefed to the Minister as a whole contradicted thatclaim, andsubmitted that the Literature Review plainly made that point.Thedefendantssubmitted thatit is clear that thedocuments read as a whole advised the Minister that aerial shooting can be better than or equivalent to other forms of control provided certain conditions were applied, including trained shooters. Thedefendantssubmitted that,to the extent that the plaintiff argues to the contrary, the argumentis an attempt at a merits review.Thedefendantssubmitted that animal welfare is merely one factor to betaken into account. Thedefendantssubmitted further that the precise method of implementation of anyparticular controlmethod was not a matter the Ministerwas statutorily bound to take into account.The provisions of theKWHHAct do not elevate animal welfare above the protection of the environment.Thedefendantssubmitted that even if the Court were to find that any statement or summary given to the Minister was incomplete or inaccurate, it would not follow that the Minister thereby committed jurisdictional error. Reliance was placed onMinister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs v McQueen[2024] HCA 11;(2024) 98 ALJR 594at [35]-[38]. Thedefendantssubmitted that a factual misstatement does not give rise to jurisdictional error. It could not be said that the Minister failed totake into accountwelfare considerations in deciding to amend the plan to authorise aerial shooting. The Minister clearly did so, and the consequence is that, even if the impugned statements in the summaries were incomplete and misleading, they would not vitiatethe Minister’s decision.ConsiderationTheKWHHAct relevantly provides:4Object of ActThe object of this Act is to recognise the heritage value of sustainable wild horse populations within parts of Kosciuszko National Park and to protect that heritage.Part 2 Wild horse heritage management plan5Preparation of draft wild horse heritage management plan(1)  The Chief Executive is to cause a draft wild horse heritage management plan to be prepared for Kosciuszko National Park (thedraft plan).(2) The draft plan is to:(a) identify the heritage value of sustainable wild horse populations within identified parts of the park, and(b) set out how that heritage value will be protected while ensuring other environmental values of the park (including values identified in the plan of management for the park) are also maintained, and(c)take into accountthe object of this Act, and(d)take into accountthe objects of theNational Parks and Wildlife Act 1974and the matters that are required (by section 72AA of that Act) tobe taken into consideration in the preparation of a plan of management, and(e) include any other matter prescribed by the regulations.(3) …6Public consultation on draft plan(1)  The Chief Executive is to give notice of the public exhibition of the draft plan by publishing the notice in the Gazette and in any other manner that the Chief Executive considers to be appropriate.(2) …8Draft plan and representations to be given toMinisterThe Chief Executive is, as soon as practicable after the end of the later of the periods referred to in section 6 or 7, to forward a copy of the following to the Minister for consideration:(a)  the draft plan,(b)  any representation on the draft plan by the Chief Executive,(c)  any representations received under section 6 or 7,(d)  a summary of any representations received under section 6.9Adoption of planThe Minister may, after considering the following, adopt the draft plan without alteration or with such alterations as the Minister thinks fit or may refer it back to the Chief Executive for further consideration:(a)  the draft plan,(b)  any representations made by the Chief Executive, the AdvisoryCouncilor the Heritage Council under this Part,(c)  any representations made by other persons under this Part (or a summary of those representations).10Adoptedplanmust be carried out and given effect toAn adopted plan must be carried out and given effect to by the Chief Executive.11Amending or replacing adoptedplans(1)  The Minister may, at any time, direct the Chief Executive to prepare a draft amending plan to make amendments to an adopted plan or to prepare a new draft plan to replace an adopted plan.(2)  An amending plan when adopted amends the adopted plan and a new draft plan when adopted repeals any previous adopted plan.(3)  Sections 6–9 apply to a draft amending plan in the same way as those sections apply to a draft plan.…12   Relationship with National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974(1)  An adopted plan prevails to the extent of any inconsistency between the adopted plan and a plan of management.(2)  Without limiting subsection (1), section 81 (4) of theNational Parks and Wildlife Act 1974does not apply in relation to anything done to carry out or give effect to an adopted plan.(3)  When causing a plan of management for Kosciuszko National Park to be prepared, the Chief Executive must ensure that the plan of management recognises the heritage value of sustainable wild horse populations within parts of the park.(The reference to “Chief Executive”throughout the Act isto be understood as a reference to the “Secretary of the Department.)Section 9 specifies only three groups of things which must be considered by the Minister.Section 5 sets out what is to be dealt with in the draft plan. That requires mandatory consideration of the matters in s 72AA of theNational Parks and Wildlife Act 1974(NSW)(“the NPW Act”).Animal welfare is notincluded in either ss5 or9. The plaintiff submitted that animal welfare iscontained within the understanding of“heritage value”of the horses.The submission relied ons4of theKWHHAct and, presumably although not clearly articulated, the fact that the draft plan is by virtue of s 5(2) to identify and protect that heritage value.That heritage value is, however, of“sustainable”wild horse populations. That appears to recognise that the population of wild horses needs to be culled from time to time. How that occurs must have regard to legislation concerned with humane treatment of animals including their killing, such as thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979(NSW)(“the PCA Act”).Anotherlikely reason for animal welfare being a mandatory consideration is that the Minister is required to consider the representationsof the Secretary and of the“other persons”, being members of the public by virtue of s 6.It is clear that asignificant issue in those representations was the issue of animal welfare. That was at least partly because 73% of public submissions of those opposed to aerial shooting (18% in total) voiced concerns about impacts on animalwelfare. Those representations were summarised in theSecondDecisionBrief, and the Secretary provided recommendations about them. Both were required to be considered under s 9. If the Minister did not do so, jurisdictional error would be established:Craig v The State of South Australia(1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179;Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf(2001) 206 CLR 323; [2001] HCA 30 at [82].For thesereasons, andgiven what is set out in section 6.2 of the Amended Plan and what can be discerned from the previous iteration of the Plan by reason of the amendments proposed (the unamended Plan was not in evidence), it should be accepted that consideration of animal welfareisa mandatory consideration in the preparation of the plan or its amendment.What must,however, be borne in mind is that animal welfare was not the only mandatory consideration, nor the most significant.Nor can there be any doubt that animal welfare considerations were certainlytaken into accountby the Minister in approving the Amended Plan. It was the information provided to the Minister about those animal welfare concerns which gave rise to the principal challenge to the Minister’s decision.InMcQueenthe High Court determined the issue of what information a Minister, exercising a power personally, is obliged to consider, and the extent to which the Minister can rely on information provided by the Department, including summaries of submissions. It was accepted in that case that the Minister did not read or consider actual representations made by the other party, but only submissions and draft reasons provided by the Department.The joint judgment ofGagelerCJ, Gordon, Edelman,Stewardand Gleeson JJ said:[19] Theforegoing permits a Minister to rely on his or her department to sift and organise material received, to prepare summaries of information, and to prioritise correspondence. Generally, there is no obligation on a Minister to readeach and everyrelevant document in order to exercise a power personally. These principles were described by Brennan J inPeko-Wallsendas follows:The Department does not have to draw the Minister’s attention to every communication it receives and to every fact its officers know. Part of a Department’s function is to undertake an analysis,evaluationand précis of material to which the Minister is bound to have regard or to which the Minister may wish to have regard in making decisions.The press of ministerial business necessitates efficient performance of that departmental function. The consequence of supplying a departmental analysis, evaluation and précis is, of course, that the Minister’s appreciation of a case depends to a great extent upon the appreciation made by his Department. Reliance on the departmental appreciation is not tantamount to an impermissible delegation of ministerial function. A Minister may retain his power to make a decision while relying on hisDepartmentto draw his attention to the salient facts. But if his Department fails to do so, and the validity of the Minister’s decision depends upon his having had regard to the salient facts, his ignorance of the facts does not protect the decision. The Parliament can be taken to intend that the Minister will retain control of the process of decision-making while being assisted to make the decision by departmental analysis,evaluationand précis of the material relevant to that decision.[20] Relyingon the work of a governmental department does not immunise the Minister from errors of law made by departmental officers. Attribution of the knowledge of the department to the Minister means that the mistakes of the department are also those of the Minister. As Gibbs CJ observed inPeko-Wallsend:[I]f the Minister relies entirely on a departmental summary which fails to bring to his attention a material fact which he is bound to consider, and which cannot be dismissed as insignificant or insubstantial, the consequence will be that he will have failed to take that material fact into account and will not have formed his satisfaction in accordance with law.[21] Theforegoing principles were affirmed by the Full Court of the Federal Court inTickner v Chapman, whereKiefelJ said:I have earlier said that the Minister may seek the assistance of his staff. A ‘consideration’ of the representations does not in my view require him to personally read each representation. But it may be as well for him to do so, for if his staff are to convey what is contained withinthemthey must do so in a way which provides a full account of what is in them. If they do not, the Minister will not have considered something he is obliged to, and in this respect the observations of Gibbs CJ inPeko-Wallsendat 30 as to what results are apposite. It may vitiate his decision.[22] Theywere again endorsed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in relation to the Minister’s power to cancel a visa pursuant to s 501(3) of the Act inCarrascalaov Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. The Full Court there expressed the following three qualifications to the general principle that a Minister may rely on departmental summaries of material: first, reliance upon a materially deficient summary may give rise to an inference that the decision-making process was improper; secondly, the use of a summary may not be appropriate when it seeks to capture a substantive argument if the force of the submission is thereby lost; and thirdly, account must be taken by a Minister of any statement in a summary which advises the Minister to consider a particular document or documents. InCarrascalao, it had not been suggested that the summary relied upon had been inaccurate orincomplete, ordid not convey the force of any argument made. As a result, the Minister was entitled to rely upon it. Because that summary also directed the Minister to the material itself (which was attached to the summary) the Minister was also obliged to turn his mind to whether he needed to refer to that material directly.…[28] Itis a matter for the Minister to determine how to be satisfied as to whether “another reason” exists to justify revocation of a cancellation decision. Naturally, that can include personally reading and understandingall ofthe submissions. But that is not the only way the Minister’s function may be discharged. There is no barrier to the Minister reading and understanding the representations made by an applicant by other methods including the method of relying only upon a departmental summary of them, so long as that summary is accurate and contains a full account of the essential content.…[35] Therespondent sought to raise, without filing a notice of contention, a second issue, namely whether the summary in the Submission and draft reasons was “deficient”. He relied upon the statement made by the primary judge, and accepted by the Full Court, that it was not possible to discern “the full sense and content of the representations made” from those documents. This was said to be an unchallenged finding of fact.[36]Withoutdeciding whether the respondent was entitled to rely upon this alternative contention, it is nonetheless misconceived for three reasons. In the first place, the statement of the primary judge was not a finding of fact; it was instead a characterisation of the Department’s work.Secondly, the observation that the summaries did not convey the “full sense and content” of the representations is one that might be made about any summary of material. A summary will, of necessity, edit the material received; it will reduce the quantum of the representations to the essence of what is needed for a Minister to reach the state of satisfaction mandated by s 501CA(4). So long as the representations are appropriate to be summarised and that process of distillation is accurate and provides a full account of the essential content, it will be lawful for the Minister to read the summary and nothing more. Thirdly, the primary judge’s conclusion falls short of identifying jurisdictional error. It was not at any stage suggested that any part of the content of the Submission and draft reasons wasactually incorrectin describing the representations received. Nor was it contended that anyparticular representationhad failed to be included. Even if this had occurred, it would not necessarily follow, for the reasons given, that the Minister had thereby failed to take into consideration a mandatorily relevant matter.(citationsomitted)There are twosignificant differencesbetween the position inMcQueenand the present case. First,the Minister in the present case had not only the summary of representations and the Secretary’s recommendations in response to thosesummaries, but she also had the underlying documents that formed the basis of the Secretary’s commentary and recommendations.Secondly, it is not suggested in the present case that the representations were not properly summarised. The challenge was, rather, to the Secretary’s recommendations. The former of those differences is significant, but I accept thatMcQueenis relevant analogously to some extent.Bearing in mind the principles set out inMcQueen, I do not consider that the Minister’s decision was madeon the basis ofincomplete, inadequate, misleading or unfair information. The Secretary was not obliged to draw to the Minister’s attentionevery fact its officers knew about aerial shooting outcomes in terms of animal welfare.One reason for that is that it was no part of the Minister’s task to reach a conclusion on how the aerial shooting was to be carried out. It was not for the Minister to weigh up the relative impacts of one method of conducting aerial shooting overanother, nor to be satisfied that all outcomes would fall within Scenario 1.Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission (set out at [27] above) much more information than what was contained in that paragraph was provided to the Minister about animal welfare concerns.First, what was contained in the body of the SecondDecisionBrief was this:An independent, expert review of current published scientific literature in August 2023 concludes thataerial shooting results in animal welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations(Tab 11). The review was provided to and publicly released as part of responses to questions on notice from the Senate Inquiry.If you decide to adopt the final draft amending plan, aerial shooting of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park would be carried out to the highest animal welfare standards. This will include the development of a standard operating procedure (SOP) informed by independent expert veterinary and animal welfare advice and involve ongoing auditing by animal welfare experts. The NPWS SOP would meet Australian and NSW legislative requirements.A draft SOP has been developed for a preliminary aerial shooting program in consultation with an independent wildlife veterinarian and RSPCA NSW (Tab 12). The draft SOP will be finalised and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General if the final amending plan is adopted. The SOP for the full operational program will then be developed and finalised based on outcomes of thepreliminary program and independent animal welfare advice and approved by the Acting Coordinator-General.Once approved, the final SOP will be followed in all future wild horse aerial shooting programs in the park and remain under active, ongoing review.(emphasisadded)The italicised portion (above) was taken from the Literature Review (set out at [14] above in the second paragraph of the extract). The plaintiff, nevertheless, was critical of the Secretary omitting the word“therefore”before the word“results”. The omissionwas scarcely surprising because the details in the Literature Review were notset out in that part of the SecondDecisionBrief. Nor did they need to be set out there. The material was contained in the Literature Review to which specific reference was made in the same paragraph.The plaintiff submitted that there was nothing to suggest that the Minister had read the Literature Review, partly because it contained no markings and partly because it was not identified within the Recommendations at the beginning of the SecondDecisionBrief. In my opinion, it should not be inferred that the Minister did not readnor refer tothe Literature Review. It was expressly identified in the paragraph set out above, and it is for the plaintiff to discharge its onus of proving what it asserts.Even if it could be shown that the Minister did not have any regard to the Literature Review, I do not consider that what was contained in the SecondDecisionBrief was misleading or inadequate. It was nowhere being asserted that in every caseaerial shooting would lead to outcomes in accordance withScenario1.It was self-evident that such could not be the case.The2017HamptonSurvey(a largestudyinvolving about 1000 horses)produced a result of 63% of horses rendered insensible instantly. It was accepted that a minority was closer to Scenario 2but that was explained (as the Literature Review noted) by shooter skill.Further, more aspects of the Literature Review were set out in theSecretary’sRecommendations when responding to the summaries of the arguments putforward by the members of the public against aerial shooting. These are contained in the Table 5 in [18] abovebut should be repeated here:The literature supports that the keys to successful aerial operations depend on using highly skilled and experienced shooters and pilots, ensuring multiple shots (‘overkill’), and shooting in relatively open areas. When skilled operators work in open areas with multiple shots to each animal, the outcomes for animals are consistent with the highest animal welfare standards. Aerial shooting results in welfare outcomes that are equivalent to and better than all other control operations.In the passage in the SecondDecisionBrief (set out at [13] aboveunder the heading“Draft standard operating procedure for preliminary program has been prepared”), the Minister was told that if she decided to adopt the proposed Amended Plan, aerial shooting“would be carried out to the highest animal welfare standards”, that this would involve the development of a standard operating procedure(“SOP”)which would be informedby“independent expert veterinary and animal welfare advice”.A similar statement was made at the conclusion of the Secretary’s Recommendation following the passage set out above (at[55]).Some detail in that regard was provided to the Minister in the document annexed to the Second Brief atTab 12(the Preliminary Program SOP), immediately following the Literature Review. Tab 12 was specifically drawn to the Minister’s attention, and she indicated by a tick at the front of the SecondDecisionBrief that she hadnoted the draft SOP.The fact that a SOP was to be prepared in relation to how, precisely, the aerial shooting was to be carried out, is a clear indication that the Minister was not required to immerse herself in the possible methods to be employed. It is also a clear indicationthat the statements made in the SecondDecisionBrief by the Secretary cannot be regarded as categorical statements of outcomes from the proposed aerial shooting. Those statements were appropriately extracted from the Literature Review having regard to what was proposed as discussed in the Preliminary Program SOP.The plaintiff drew attention in some detail to what was contained in the report of the ITRG in 2015 entitled“Assessing the humaneness of wild horse management methods”, and in thereport of theScientific Advisory Panel (SAP) in 2020to submit that best practice for aerial shooting contained the qualifications which those documents discussed.I do not accept that the detail discussed in those documents and others had to be drawn to the Minister’s attention.That information was not material to the Minister’s decision because her obligation was to consider issues of animal welfare, not to determine the methods by which animal welfare was to be protected.In any event these documents do not say that Scenario 1 outcomes are the only acceptable outcomes in animal welfare terms.Further, the SAP 2020reportcontained a list of control methods that were not recommended. Aerial shooting was not amongst them.Theplaintiff’ssubmissions, in this regard, tended to verge towards a merits review of the decision to authorise aerial shooting.For example, attention was drawn to where in the SAP it was said that there was limited data on actual animal welfare outcomes for all available methods of control. The submissions seemed to argue that unless Scenario 1 outcomes were achievable in all cases, aerial shooting should not be permitted.That is a challenge based on merits and not on whether there was jurisdictional error.The present challenge to the Minister’s decision is, and only can be, a challenge based on the information that was supplied to the Minister, and on her decision based on that information.Nothing that was contained in the SecondDecisionBrief guaranteed that there would be the best outcome in all cases.It is necessary to reiterate what was said inMinister for Aboriginal Affairsv Peko-WallsendLtd(1986) 162 CLR 24 Brennan J said at 65 (in a passage picked up by the High Court inMcQueenat [19]):The Department does not have to draw the Minister’s attention to every communication it receives and to every fact its officers know. Part of a Department’s function is to undertake an analysis,evaluationand précis of material to which the Minister is bound to have regard or to which the Minister may wish to have regard in making decisions.The plaintiff’s complaint, evident from the detail the Court was taken to by the plaintiff’s counsel from the various documents, papers and studies, was in substance that the Secretary should have provided to the Minister far more detailabout animal welfare considerationsthan was contained in the Second Brief, or at least to have provided the information in the substantiveearly parts of the Briefrather than in attachments.The Minister was provided with the Literature Review which considered the then current state of knowledge about contingencies that affected animal welfare outcomes. What was set out in the Second Decision Brief contained an accurate summary of the Literature Review with reference being made to the contingencies (the skill of the pilots, shooters and the location of the shooting) (Cf the italicised extracts from the Literature Review at [14] and [15] above with the italicised portion at [13] above and what appears in Table 5 at [18] above).As noted, the Second Decision Brief said that a SOP would be developed with reliance on experts in animal welfare. That would be finalised based on outcomes of a preliminary program. Thereafter, the matter would be under active, ongoing review.The information provided to the Minister was not inadequate or misleading. In terms of the Minister’s obligation to consider animal welfare, no material information was omitted by the Secretary.Itneeds to be stressed that animal welfare was not the only consideration for the Minister, nor was it a paramount consideration. As the document in the SecondDecisionBrief atTab 6 made clear,other considerations included the management of the wild horse population to be integrated with aerial shooting of other target species, the need to minimise the environmental and heritage impact of the horse population, and the need to move quickly to keep the horse population down because of the natural and indigenous cultural values of the KNP.In circumstances where animal welfare considerations were but one factor to be considered, where the SecondDecisionBrief contained the relevant information about welfare outcomes in the Literature Review and that Literature Review was expressly referred to in the body of theSecondDecisionBrief, and where the Secretary had properly extracted aspects of the Literature Review including references to the qualifications to outcomes, I do not consider that the Minister’s decision was made other than on the basis of relevantand sufficientinformation.This ground is not made out.Grounds 4 and 5Grounds 4 and 5 were in these terms:Ground 44.When deciding to adopt the Plan, the First Defendant made an error of law in relation to the use of aerial shooting of wild horses as a control method and thereby committed jurisdictional error.a.The First Defendant concluded in the Plan that the use of aerial shooting of wild horses “[f]or use in any area of the park”, without any preference for other control methods other than by reference to “operational factors”, was an approach that was consistent with thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979(NSW).b.This was an error of law. The use of aerial shooting of wild horses “[f]or use in any area of the park”, without preference for other control methods other than by reference to “operational factors”, is an approach that is likely to “unreasonably, unnecessarily or unjustifiably\" inflict pain upon wildhorsescontrary to s 5 of thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979(NSW).Ground 55.When deciding to adopt the Plan, the First Defendant acted in a legally unreasonable way in relation to the use of aerial shooting of wild horses as a control method and thereby committed jurisdictional error.a.The First Defendant concluded in the Plan that aerial shooting of wild horses could be used “in any area of the park”, without preference for other control methods other than by reference to “operational factors”.b.The First Defendant was aware, and it is the fact that, aerial shooting gives rise to significant risks of inflicting pain upon wild horsesthat are qualitatively and/or quantitatively different from other control methods.c.However, the Plan does not provide that other control methods should be used in preference to aerial shooting where that is operationally possible.d.To the contrary, the Plan states that there is no hierarchy or preference between control methods other than what is considered operationally efficient.e.In light ofthe known animal welfare risks arising from aerial shooting, there was no evident or intelligible justification for the First Defendant to proceed in this way.SubmissionsThe plaintiff submitted that s 6.3 of the Plan provides that aerial shooting is for use in any area of theKNP. The plaintiff submitted that the Minister appears to have concludedfrom clause 6.2 of the Plan (dealing with animal welfare) that the use of aerial shooting in any area of theKNPwas consistent with thePCA Act. The plaintiff submitted, however, that in the light of what was contained in ITRG 2015 that the use of aerial shooting in any area of theKNPwithout preference for other control methods other than by refence to“operational factors”is an approach that is likely to“unreasonably, unnecessarily or unjustifiably”inflict painupon wild horses, and isthuscontrary to s 5 of thePCA Act.The plaintiff submitted that because the Amended Plan stated that there was no hierarchy or preference between control methods, and in the light of known animal welfare risks arising from aerial shooting there was no evident or intelligible justification for the Minister to proceed in that way. Accordingly, the Minister’s approach was submitted to be legally unreasonable.ConsiderationWhat is understood as legal unreasonableness was set out by the High Court inMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li(2013) 249 CLR 332; [2013] HCA 18.Tthejoint judgment of Hayne,Kiefeland Bell JJ said:[72]The more specific errors in decision-making, to which the courts often refer, may also be seen as encompassed by unreasonableness. This may be consistent with the observations of Lord Greene MR, that some decisions may be considered unreasonable in more than one sense and that “all these things run into one another”. Further, inMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd, Mason J considered that the preferred ground for setting aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of greatimportance, orhas given excessive weight to an irrelevant factor of no importance, is that the decision is “manifestly unreasonable”. Whether a decision-maker be regarded, by reference to the scope and purpose of the statute, as having committed a particular error in reasoning, given disproportionate weight to some factor or reasoned illogically or irrationally,the final conclusionwill in each case be that the decision-maker has been unreasonable in a legal sense.…[75]InPeko-Wallsend, Mason J, having observed that there was considerable diversity in the application by the courts of the test of manifest unreasonableness, suggested that “guidance may be found in the close analogy between judicial review of administrative action and appellate review of a judicial discretion”.House v The Kingholds that it is not enough that an appellate court would have taken a different course.What must be evident is that some error has been made in exercising the discretion, such as where a judge acts on a wrong principle or takes irrelevant matters into consideration.The analogy with the approach taken in an administrative law context is apparent.[76]As to the inferences that may be drawn by an appellate court, it was said inHouse v The Kingthat an appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion “if upon the facts [the result] is unreasonable or plainly unjust”.The same reasoning might apply to the review of the exercise of a statutory discretion, where unreasonableness is an inference drawn from the facts and from the matters falling for consideration in the exercise of the statutory power.Even where some reasons have been provided, as is the case here, it may nevertheless not be possible for a court to comprehend how the decision was arrived at. Unreasonableness is a conclusion which may be applied to a decision which lacks an evident and intelligible justification.(citationsomitted)Liwas concerned with legal unreasonableness in relation to a discretionary decision made under a statutory provision. Both parties accepted, however,that, because the present matter involved delegated legislation, being the Amended Plan, the higher standard of legal unreasonableness identified inAttorney-General for the State of South Australia v Adelaide City Corporation(2013) 249 CLR 1; [2013] HCA 3, was the appropriate test. In that case, French CJ said:[48]A high threshold test for unreasonableness invalidating delegated legislation was set by the Privy Council inSlattery v Naylor. Their Lordships spoke of a “merely fantastic and capriciousbye-law, such as reasonable men could not make in good faith”. That criterion did not invite judicial merits review of delegated legislation. Nor has unreasonableness ever been so regarded in this Court. As their Lordships said, a by-law would not be treated as unreasonable “merely because it does not contain qualifications which commend themselves to the minds of judges”. InKruse v Johnson, Lord Russell CJ accorded a particular respect to the authority conferred on public representative bodies in making delegated legislation which would not necessarily inform consideration of validity today. However, he did not exclude from review by-laws “partial and unequal in their operation” or “manifestly unjust” or involving “such oppressive or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men”.[49]The high threshold approach to invalidating unreasonableness was reflected early in the life of this Court inWidgeeShire Council v Bonney, where Griffith CJ, after referring toSlattery v NaylorandKruse v Johnson, said:The existence of a power and the expediency of its exercise are quite different matters.The question of the existence of the power can always be determined by a Court of law.But, in my opinion, the expediency of the exercise of a power is not a matter for determination by a Court.The reasoning of Isaacs J was to similar effect, although he specifically referred to the limiting case formulated inSlattery v Naylor. Allthe Justices treated unreasonableness, so understood, as going to power. The point was made plainly by Higgins:Questions as to the validity of by-laws really come under the ordinary principles applicable to powers; and when it is said that a by-law is unreasonable, and therefore invalid, what is really meant is that the provisions in the by-law cannot reasonably be regarded as being within the scope or ambit or purpose of the power. The language used in Courts of equitywith regard topowers seems to me to be more appropriate, and to conduce to greater clearness of thought.[50]This Court continued to treat invalidating unreasonableness, in relation to delegated legislation, in a limiting high threshold sense concerned with “the contemplated ambit of power”. InWilliams v Melbourne Corporation, Dixon J said:Although in some jurisdictions the unreasonableness of a by-law made under statutory powers by a local governing body is still considered a separate ground of invalidity, in this Court it is not so treated.(citationsomitted)Although the plaintiff’s focuswas on the fact that aerial shooting was said to be for use in any area of theKNP, that tended to ignore what was set out in clause 6.2 of the Plan (set out at [20] above). That clause made clear that all controlmethods would be implemented consistent with relevant animal welfare legislation, and that standard operating procedures would be developed following engagement with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and relevant specialists as required.The Amended Plan also said that standard operating procedures would be developed thatwere tailored for use in the KNP.In those circumstances, there was no error of law in the Minister’sdecision, norcanthe Minister’s decisionbe said to be unreasonable even totheListandard of unreasonableness,and certainly notin terms of the test set out inAdelaide City Corporation.The decision was within the contemplated ambit of power.I have already concluded that the Ministertook into accountrelevant animal welfare considerations when authorising the Amended Plan.The complaintin these groundswas alsosimilar tothe challenge to ground 3. It was not the Minister’s task to decided how or where the aerial shooting was to take place. That is an operational matter that forms part of a consideration of the merits of the decision.These grounds fail.Ground 1The implementation of the Amended PlanGround 1 said this:1.The First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant are acting contrary to law in purporting to carry out and give effect to the Plan:a.The method of aerial shooting being adopted by the First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant is contrary to“HOR002 - Aerial shooting of feral horses”(2011) and therefore contrary to the Plan.b.The method of aerial shooting being adopted by the First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant is not supported by any animal welfare assessment and/or is contrary to the animal welfare assessment performed by theKosziuskoWild Horse Independent Technical Reference Group and is therefore contrary to the Plan.c.The method of aerial shooting being adopted by the First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant is contrary to thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979(NSW) and is therefore contrary to the Plan.d.This conduct is contrary to Section 10 of theKosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act 2018(NSW).SubmissionsTheplaintiff submitted that the Amended Plan is to be carried out in accordance with the various requirements set out in the Amended Plan including the 2011 SOPand the NPWS Aerial Shooting SOP 2023. The plaintiff submitted that those two documents were inconsistent because the SOP 2011 said that aerial shooting should not be done if the nature of the terrain reduces accuracy,resulting in too many wounding shots, and that target horses should be mustered away from areas of dense vegetation before being shot.On the other hand, nothing was said in the SOP 2023 about shooting only in open areas and not in areas of dense vegetation.Theomissionin the SOP2023was said to be deliberatebecause in the report of the preliminary program, the following appeared:It is worth noting that there is also an Australian national SOP for the aerial shooting of feral horses (Sharp 2011), but this more general document was not the focus for this operation. The terrain and vegetation types typical ofshooting only in openKosciuszko National Park (see section 1.2.2) are generally thought to create challenges for aerialshooting. The national SOP do not advocate aerial shooting in sloping areasor in areas with extensive vegetation cover (Sharp 2011), two unavoidable aspects of operating in Kosciuszko National Park.The plaintiff submitted that other aspects of SOP 2011 were not reflected in SOP 2023. Those concerned procedures that resulted in Scenario 1 outcomes. Nor, the plaintiff submitted,werethereconsiderations under the PCA Acthaving regard to the definition of cruelty in s4(2) of that Act.The plaintiff submitted that the shooting has not been subject to any animal welfare assessment.In thoseways,the plaintiff submitted,the Amended Plan could not be implemented in accordancewith its requirements.ConsiderationSection 10 of the KWHH Act requires the Amended Plan to be carried out and given effect.In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails fora number ofreasons. First, the SOP 2011, which“is a guide only”,does not prohibit aerial shooting in areas of high vegetation. It allows that it might occur. Under the heading “Application”the following appears:Aerial shooting is used to control feral horses in remote,inaccessibleor rugged terrain where horses cannot be caught…In areas of heavy cover (egvegetated creek lines, woodlands and forest),effectiveness is limited since horses might be concealed and difficult to locate from the air.Secondly, it was a guide put in place at a time when aerial shooting was not permitted in New South Wales. The SOP 2023 was specifically devised in the light of the changes to the Plan to permit aerial shooting. In some ways it is inconsistent with the development in learning that has occurred since it was adopted. For example,under the heading “Procedures” the following appears:For aerial shooting, the initial shot to the chest is preferred since it is easier to achieve with a moving animal.Thatisentirely contrary to what is contained in ITRG 2015 and in the Literature Review particularlyas a result ofthe2017HampdenSurvey.Thirdly,in regard tovegetation, SOP 2011 and SOP2023 are capable of being read together since SOP2023 does not require or even authorise aerial shooting in areas of heavy cover.Fourthly, the Amended Plan says:The following actions will be undertaken for each control method available for use on wild horses in the park:1.Develop standard operating procedures that are tailored for use in the park.The Amended Plan requires the horse population to be reduced to 3000 by 30 June 2027. Thathas tobe done having regard to the topography and the vegetation in the KNP,hence the need for tailoring the procedures for use in theKNPhaving regard to what was containedin the report of the preliminary operation (at [81] above).Fifthly, even if there is a measure of inconsistency between documents that are referred to as being relevant to animal welfare outcomes, implementation of the plan is not rendered invalid or unlawful by the method of implementation. InNeilson v Secretary, Department of Planning and Environment[2024] NSWCA 28 Payne JA (Ward P and White JA agreeing) said:[45]The crucial provision is s 81 of the NPW Act. The relevant parts of which are set out at [24] above. The nature and scope of the duty imposed by s 81(1) of the NPW Act, and any discretion to perform the duty imposed, are to be construed by reference to the text of s 81, considered in light of its context and purpose:SZTALat [14] (KiefelCJ, Nettle and Gordon JJ);SAS Trustee Corporation v Miles(2018) 265 CLR 137; [2018] HCA 55 at [20] (KiefelCJ, Bell and Nettle JJ), [41] (GagelerJ), [64] (Edelman J). The primary judge was correct to determine the nature and scope of the respondent’s duty and discretion by reference to the relevant statutory text andin light ofits context and purpose.[46]As to the text of s 81(1), the respondent is vested with a power and a singular duty to carry out and give effect to a plan of management. Here, that power and singular duty is for the Secretary to carry out and give effect to (that is, to implement) the Plan of Management for the Mimosa Rocks National Park. Section 81 does not prescribe what it means to “carry out” or “give effect” to a plan of management. It clearly does not specify that a plan of management is carried out or given effect to only if every policy and action it proposes be completed, in a reasonable time or at all.[47]As to context, the legislative materials tend against any conclusion that the legislature intended to require the Secretary to carry out as separate obligations every “policy or action” in a plan of management. When the National Parks and Wildlife Bill 1974 (NSW) was under consideration in the Legislative Council, a member proposed an amendment which would have forbidden the authority responsible for a given protected area from granting an easement contrary to a plan of management. The Minister for Planning and Environment and Vice-President of the Executive Council refused to support the amendment, saying:The Government is not willing to go that far. As I see the amendment […] it is adequately covered by clause 81(1) in the powers of the director to implement the plan of management.He is obliged to go to a certain stage in his basic obligation to implement the plan.(New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 October 1974, 2309) (emphasis added).Sixthly, the evidence clearly establishes that an animal welfare assessment hadbeencarried out for the preliminary program. The letter from the RSPCA dated 1 December 2023 reads as follows:I am responding to your letter regarding observations made by RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector, Scott Meyers during the preliminary program for the aerial shooting of horses in Kosciuszko National Park, as conducted by National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in accordance with the Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan under the Kosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Act (2018).In response to your questions, please see thefollowing;1.Advise whether the RSPCA NSW was able toadequately andindependently observe thepreliminary program.RSPCA NSW's Chief Inspector was able to independently observe the preliminary program for the aerial shooting of horses in Kosciuszko National Park.2.Advisea.whether the Standard Operating Procedure for the preliminary program Is consistent with best practice; andRSPCA NSW's Chief Inspector observed the Standard Operating Procedures used by NPWS for the preliminary program of aerial shooting of horses in Kosciuszko National Park. In terms of best practice, RSPCA NSW advises that any operations ought to continue in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures established by NPWS.b.whether the RSPCA NSW observed any departures from the Standard Operating Procedure during the conduct of the preliminary program.RSPCA NSW's Chief Inspector did not observe any departures from the Standard Operating Procedures during the preliminary program for theaerial shooting of horses in Kosciuszko National Park during the two days this activity took place.3.Advise whether the RSPCA NSW observed any non-compliance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.RSPCA NSW's Chief Inspector did not observe any non-compliance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1979) during the preliminary program for the aerial shooting of horses in Kosciuszko National Park during the two days this activity took place.4.Provide any other advice or recommendationsInrelation to future aerial control operations,RSPCA NSW's Chief Inspector conductedfirst handobservations of the aerial control operations as described above and as a result has no further advice or recommendations at this time.Finally, the only evidence of what has happened in relation to the carrying out of the aerial shooting is what is contained in the report of the preliminary program. TheExecutive Summary reads as follows:This report describes an independent animal welfare assessment of a preliminary aerial shooting program targeting feral horses [Equus caballus) in Kosciuszko National Park. Field observations were performed by two independent veterinarians of 277 horses that were targeted for shooting over two days in November 2023. Parameters relevant to animal welfare were quantified, including the duration of procedures, and the frequency of adverse animal welfare events (including non-fatal wounding). Ground-based inspections were used for a subset of 43 horses that were assessed immediately (median of 3 minutes) after shooting. These inspections allowed examination for insensibility and death, and characterisation of the number and location of bullet wounds. Of all horses pursued, 97% were killed, with 3% escaping without being shot at. No feral horses observed were non- fatally wounded. The median time for combined helicopter pressure and pursuit was 84 seconds, and the median time to insensibility from shooting was 5 seconds. Repeat shooting was performed consistently, withanmean of 7.5 shots fired at each horse, and 98% of bullet wounds were found in the thorax. While acknowledging the preliminary nature of this assessment, animal welfare outcomes were comparable to past investigations of aerial shooting, with a notable absence of adverse animal welfare events and a comparatively high number of shots fired peranimal. With respectto indirect animal welfare impacts imposed on other wild animals inhabiting the same environment, the use of lead-free ammunition eliminated the risk of lead poisoning in wildlife scavenging horse carcasses.There is no evidence that theAmendedPlan is being carried out contrary to law, whether the PCA Act or otherwise. The evidence is to the contrary.This groundfails.StandingIn the light of my conclusions about the grounds of appeal it is not strictly necessary to say anything about the two remaining issues that were argued, being the question of the plaintiff’s standing and the need for an extension of time to bring the present proceedings. However, in deference to the arguments presented, and in case this matter goes further, I will say something briefly about each of these issues.SubmissionsThe plaintiff submitted that it had a special interest in bringing the proceedings and, as a result, has standing to do so. In support of its special interest, the plaintiff pointed to the following matters:The plaintiff is a not-for-profit voluntary organisation which advocates for the rightto freedom of access toKNP, and itsparticular connectiontoKNPis different from that of the public at large.The plaintiff has approximately 900 members with different interests, but all are recreational users ofKNP. They include horse enthusiasts, walkers, skiers, fishermen, boating enthusiasts, campers and motor vehicle drivers and rider.The plaintiff’s main purpose is to protectKNP’s mountain heritage, traditions and the environment whilst providing access,equityand sustainable recreational use to all park users.One of the plaintiff’s key goals is to promote the recognition and protection of brumbies withinKNPand to recognise their connections to pioneering history and cultural heritage.The plaintiff was integral to the preparation of theKWHHAct, andwas acknowledged as such by the relevant Minister in the Second Reading Speech.From time to time, including in relation to the proposed Amended Plan, the plaintiff has madesubmissions and gathered letters and signatures on petitions in relation to matters connected withKNP.Evidence was given of these matters by HenryFiltnesswho is thepresident of the plaintiff.The defendants drew attention to the relationship between the KWHH Act and theNPW Act. Section 81(4) of the NPW Act provides that if the Minister has adopted a plan of management under that Part of the NPW Act no operations may be taken in relation to the land to which the plan relates unless the operations are in accordance with the plan. Section 193 of the NPW Act then provides:(1)Any person may bring proceedings in the Land and Environment Court for an order to remedy or restrain a breach of this Act or the regulations,…By contrast, s 12 of the KWHH Act excludes the operation of s 81(4) of the NPW Act, presumedly because s 10 of the KWHH Act mandates that an adopted plan must be carried out and given effect to by the Secretary. However, the defendants submitted, there is no equivalent provision to s 193 in the KWHH Act, providing an indication that the plaintiff has no standing.The defendants submitted that, in any event, the plaintiff does not have a special interest that would give it standing to bring judicial review proceedings. Reliance was placed on what was said by Gibbs J inAustralian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth(1980) 146 CLR 493 at 526-527, 530 and531; and to what was said by Brennan J inOnus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd(1981) 149 CLR 27 at 74.The defendants submitted that the following matters provide a strong basis for concluding that the plaintiff does not have a special interest sufficient to confer standing:The plaintiff’s purposes are at a level of abstraction that bear only passing relevance to theparticular subjectmatter of the proceedings. The 900-odd members of the plaintiff include but are not limited to horse enthusiasts. Further, the submissions made to government in relation to the management of environmental and cultural heritage values of theKNPwere not concerned, with one exception, with the subject matter of the proceedings.The plaintiff is not uniquely involved with governments or other organisations in achieving protection for wild horses, and there is a paucity of evidence as to its activities as an incorporated association.There is a lack of evidence demonstrating a commitment to wild horse heritage values. The rally organised by the plaintiff in March 2024 to protest the closure of theKNPfor aerial culling of wild horses, was principally concerned about the effect of the closure on other recreational use of theKNP.TheKWHHAct provides no role for the plaintiff in the preparation or monitoring of the Amended Plan.There is no evidence of“concrete steps to give effect to its beliefs (as referred to inVicForestsv Kinglake Friends of the Forest Inc(2021) 66 VR 143; [2021] VSCA 195 and picked up inSouth-East Forest Rescue Inc v Forestry Corporation of NSW (No 2)[2024]NSWCA 113at [121]-[126]) concerning wild horse heritage protection such as would be demonstrated by advice, research, community engagement, interactions with NPWS, political lobbying or the development of expertise and knowledge. The defendants submitted that strong opposition to aerial shooting of wild horses is not sufficient to establish standing.ConsiderationInSouth-East Forestthe plaintiff was a group foundedin2001 and incorporated in 2010, having as its objects and purposes the carrying out of research,auditingand surveys of state forests, including documenting breaches of approvals, agreements and licenses in respect of state forests, and for the purpose of producing written information about the environment, making submissions to government and conducting walking tours of state forests.The question was whether the plaintiff lacked standingto restrain the Forestry Corporation from conducting certain forestry operations in state forests unless certain steps were taken to minimise the effects of such logging on some native species.Acting Justice Griffiths (with whom Adamson JA andBastenAJA agreed)said this:[123]An applicant who attempts to bring civil enforcement proceedings seeking declaratory and/or injunctive relief in respect of unlawful conduct and does not rely on a private right or special damage to establish standing must demonstrate a “special interest” in the subject matter of the proceeding. As expressed inKinglakeat [21], standing in the context of public law “depends on the nature and extent of the relationship between the plaintiff and the subject matter of the litigation”.[124]This raises the question of the level of abstraction with which the subject matter of the proceeding should be identified (seeKinglakeat [22]). In an environmental context, for example, is it sufficient for the applicant to demonstrate that it has an interest in the protection and preservation of the environment generally or must its interest be associated with theparticular decisionor conduct which is the subject of the proceeding?[125]Putting to one side cases where the Court is exercising a statutory jurisdiction (which may have an open standing provision or some other statutorily expressed formula for standing) and cases involving what were once described as the prerogative writs (which have their own particular and variable standing rules), the common law standing test based on the need to demonstrate a “special interest” in the subject matter of the proceeding focuses on the relative position of the applicant when compared with the broader population (seeKinglakeat [29]).[126]The “special interest” test is not confined to proprietary,businessor economic interests. But a “mere emotional or intellectual concern” is insufficient unless the applicant demonstrates that it has taken sufficient,concreteor active steps to effectuate the particular concern (seeKinglakeat [76]). The need for the interest to be special or different from those held by ordinary members of the public “is not merely a function of the depth of feeling but reflects the nature of the relationship between the person and the subject matter of the litigation” (seeKinglakeat [60(d)]).In some additional reasons of his own,BastenAJA said:[32]The enforcement of public duties was once thought to be a monopoly of the Attorney-General, so that any private individual seeking to take that role required the permission or “fiat” of the Attorney. That view has long since been abandoned in Australia. InVictoria v The Commonwealth and HaydenGibbs J tartly observed, “I would, in Australia, think it somewhat visionary to suppose that the citizens of a State could confidently rely upon the Commonwealth to protect them against unconstitutional action for which the Commonwealth itself was responsible”. To similar effect, Sir Anthony Mason observed, extrajudicially, that Attorneys-General are “not independent of government and cannot be expected to act impartially in deciding whether proceedings should be brought against the government”. In relation to a New South Wales regulatory statute, Craig J observed inHaughton v Minister for Planning and Macquarie Generationthat “the ‘gatekeeper’ for the taking of any proceedings is the very Minister whose actions are sought to be impugned as being beyond power”. As will be noted, that last observation has resonance in the present case.[33]It is unsurprising, therefore, that the law permits other persons to commence proceedings to enforce statutory obligations of public authorities, whether by orders in the nature of the former prerogative writs, or by way of equitable relief, and particularly an injunction.[34]The test now accepted as identifying the criterion for a person to commence proceedings in accordance with the general law is variously described as the existence of “special damage”, a “special interest” or a “sufficient interest”. Each of these phrases involves a level of imprecision. Theunderlying purposefor such a criterion has been identified in different ways.…[41]InOnus, Stephen J identified the deliberately amorphous criterion of “special interest” as involving “in each case a curial assessment of the importance of the concern which a plaintiff has with particular subject matter and of the closeness of that plaintiff's relationship to that subject matter”.[42]This approach is also consistent with that of Brennan J inOnus, cited with approval by the joint reasons inBateman's Bay:A special interest in the subject matter of an action being neither a legal nor equitable right, nor a proprietary or pecuniary interest, will ordinarily be found to arise from modern legislation enacted to protect or enhance non-material interests - interests in the environment, in historical heritage, in culture. Where such a statute imposes a public duty to protect or enhance a non-material interest a breach of the duty is apt to affect a non-material interest, and it would be vain to search for proprietary or pecuniary damage suffered by a plaintiff. A plaintiff in such a case, though he may be able to show a special interest in what the statute seeks to protect or enhance, would be unable to show a private right or to prove that he has suffered proprietary or pecuniary damage.To deny standing would deny to an important category of modern public statutory duties an effective procedure for curial enforcement.[43]As French CJ observed inKuczborskiv State of Queenslandto find that a proceeding raises a “matter” in federal jurisdiction “may not be sufficient to answer the question whether the plaintiff has standing”. And as the joint judgment inKuczborskiexplained, “the established requirements as to standing helped to ensure that the exercise of judicial power is informed, as fully as possible, by the ‘concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues’”. The application of that functional approach is pertinent in the present case.[44]Thus, where an applicant establishes that ithas the ability tomuster expert resources and legal representation to sharpen the presentation of issues, the nature of the interest it must demonstrate in the subject of a justiciable dispute should not be narrowly confined.(citationsomitted)In relation to the plaintiff’s standing to seek a declaration or injunction (ground 1 of the appeal) the joint judgment ofGaudron,Gummowand KirbyJJ inBateman’s Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council & Anor v The Aboriginal Community Benefits Fund Pty Ltd & Anor(1998) 194 CLR 247; [1998] HCA 49said:[24]Writing extrajudicially, Sir Anthony Mason has said that:[E]quitablerelief in the form of the declaration and the injunction have played a critical part in shaping modern administrative law which, from its earliest days, has mirrored the way in which equity has regulated the exercise of fiduciary powers.[25]In this field, equity has proceeded on the footing of the inadequacy (in particular thetechnicalities hedging the prerogative remedies) of the legal remedies otherwise available to vindicate the public interest in the maintenance of due administration. There is a public interest in restraining the apprehendedmisapplication of public funds obtained by statutory bodies and effect may be given to this interest by injunction. The position is expressed in traditional form by asking of the plaintiff whether there is “an equity” which founds the invocation of equitable jurisdiction.Similarly, inDavis v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs[2023] HCA 10; (2023) 408ALR 381 the joint judgment ofKiefelCJ,Gagelerand Gleeson JJ said at [62]:Each of Mr Davis and DCM20 has a “sufficient material interest” to seek such a declaration in relation to theparticular decisionwhich he or she impugns.That is so notwithstanding that neither has a legal right or legally protected interest which would be vindicated by the declaration and that neither had an interest which attracted any obligation of procedural fairness in the process which resulted in the making of the impugned decision.The sufficiency of their respective interests arises from the fact that it would follow from the declaration of right that their request for an exercise of the power conferred by s 351(1) of the Act is yet lawfully to be finalised.It could not be said that the declaration would produce no foreseeable consequences for the ministerial and departmental respondents or for them.(citationsomitted)In my opinion, the plaintiff has a special interest sufficient to give it standing to seek the relief contained in the amended summons for the following reasons.First, the group has been in existence for more than 20 years and its purposes relate generally to the welfare and heritage of theKNP, albeit, largely for the benefit of the different and varying interests of its members. Some of those interests relate to thecare of the environment of theKNP, and the wild horses are an integrally related issue to theKNP’s environmental status and wellbeing.Secondly, in the Second Reading Speech in relation to theKosciuszko Wild Horse Heritage Bill 2018(NSW) Mr Barilaro, the Minister for Regional NSW, said this:I acknowledge the work of Peter Cochran for leading the charge, for the community debate that he has been part of and for rallying the community to get behind this issue.Peter has been accompanied by many other people, some of whom I will name because it is right to record their names inHansardfor future generations to identify as people who fought for the right of brumbies to be recognised. They include Leisa Caldwell, Rebecca Atkinson, Jack French, Deanne Kennedy, the late Clive Edwards, Richard Armstrong, Jenny Boardman,Tedand Helen Taylor; PaulMclver; HenryFiltness, Kylee Hepburn, members of the Snowy Mountains Bush Users; Group; the Snowy Mountains Horses Riders Association and many volunteer workers across the Snowy Mountains.They have all been on this long journey, which for some has extended over two to four decades.For others like me—a Johnny-come-lately -the journey has been part of my life for the past seven years.It should be noted thatall ofthe people mentioned are members or former members of the plaintiff and Peter Cochran was the president of the plaintiff at the time. The acknowledgment by the Minister of the plaintiff’s involvement in matters which led up to the making of theKWHHAct is significant in a consideration of whether the plaintiff has a special interest.Thirdly,the plaintiff was identified as what is described as a“major stakeholder”both in an email dated 8 August 2023 seeking submissions on the draft Amended Plan, and in a list of major stakeholders as part of the material in the Second Brief to the Minister. That appears to me to show the plaintiff was regarded by the second defendant as an organisation of some significance specifically in relation to the Plan and its proposed amendment.Finally, I do not think that is of any significance that theKWHHAct does not contain any equivalent to s 193in NPW Act. That provision might be regarded as one that widened the scope of the common law enabling a personal group with a special interest to seek some form of civil relief in relation to legislation and its enforcement and observation.It does not suggest that a person or group witha”specialinterest”is, by implication, excluded from standingunder the KWHH Act. Common law principles of standing still apply.Extension of timeThe decision of the Minister was made on 23 October 2023. The proceedings commenced on 7 May 2024. To the extent that the claims are brought pursuant to Part 59 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) they are out of time. Rule 59.10 requires proceedings for judicial review to be commenced within three months of the date of the decision although sub-r (2) enables the Court to extend the time. Sub-rule (3) provides:(3)In considering whether to extend time under subrule (2), the court should take account of such factors as are relevant in the circumstances of theparticular case, including the following-(a)any particular interest of the plaintiff in challenging the decision,(b)possible prejudice to other persons caused by the passage of time, if the relief were to be granted, including but not limited to prejudice to parties to the proceedings,(c)the time at which the plaintiff became or, by exercising reasonable diligence, should have become aware of the decision,(d)any relevant public interest.As far as ground 1 is concerned, discretionary relief is being sought by way of a declaration and an injunction to halt the aerial shooting. Equitable principles of laches and delay are relevant considerations.SubmissionsThe plaintiff submitted that the following matters justify an extension of time in relation to grounds 3 to 5:The merits of thosegrounds;The validity of the Plan is a matter of significant interest to the plaintiff and itsmembers;No prejudice would be cause to the defendants in granting an extension of time. In fact, the delay in bringing the challenge has worked to the benefit of the defendants because they have been able to remove some 5,000 to 6,000 horses fromKNPusing aerialshooting;The plaintiff was not aware that aerial shooting would commence until around February 2024, and the plaintiff did not become of the three-month limitation period in r 59.10 until February2024;The issue of aerial shooting is a matter of significant public interest and concern.The defendants’principalsubmission in relation to an extension of time was that by reason of the delay the aerial control operations had been undertaken over a lengthy period.The defendant also submitted that MrFiltnessknew that the Amended Plan had been made at the end of October 2023 and that the only surprise he had about the commencement of the operation was the extent of the area of theKNPin which it was employed. The defendant submitted that there was no explanation for the delay after the plaintiff was advised of the time limitation in February 2024 before proceedings were commenced in May 2024.ConsiderationInGilmore Finance Pty Ltd vAestheteNo 3 Pty Ltd[2020] NSWCA 114, Meagher JA (with whomMacfarlanand White JJA agreed) said:[18]The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties, thereby ensuring that the time limitation does not become an instrument of injustice: per McHugh J inGallowv The Honourable Justice Dawson[1990] HCA 30; (1990) 64 ALJR 458 at 459.Accordinglyas his Honour later observed inRe Commonwealth of Australia; ExParteMarks[2000] HCA 67; (2000) 75 ALJR 470 at [15]:An extension of time for seeking relief against a decision or judgment can only be granted if it is necessary to do justice between the parties. That means that it is necessary to have regard to the history of the matter, the conduct of both parties, the nature of the litigation and the consequences for the parties of a grant or refusal of the extension.[19]In addition to the factors mentioned in r 59.10(3), matters that ordinarily will fall for consideration include the length of any delay, the reason for it and whether the applicant has a fairly arguable case:Dyasonv Butterworth[2015] NSWCA 52 at [65] (McColl JA, Barrett and Gleeson JJA agreeing) citingTomko vPalasty(No 2)(2007) 71 NSWLR 61; [2007] NSWCA 369 at [55].I accept that the plaintiff has been very tardy in commencing these proceedings, especially since the time they became aware that the aerial shooting hadactually commenced. Taking into consideration thematters in r 59.10(3) and the additional matters identified inGilmore Finance, two thingsare significant enough to justify an extension of time being given. First, the matter is both a matter of significant public interest and raises sufficiently arguable issues that an extension should not be refused. Secondly, not only is there little or no prejudice to the defendants, but the delay has been of benefit to the defendantsin the interim of carrying out the aerial shooting and thereby reducing the horse population pending the commencement of the proceedings.Since a declaration and an injunction is sought in relation to ground 1, notwithstanding that theremedies aresought to uphold what is said to becompliance with both statute and delegated legislation, the Court has an ultimate discretion whether to grant such remedies. Delay in seeking the remedies is a consideration in that discretion even if equitable concepts of laches and delay are not applicable. For the same reasons that I would extend time under r 59.10, I would also not refuse relief in relation to ground 1 by reason of the delay in commencing the proceedings.ConclusionAccordingly, I make the following orders:Extend time for the plaintiff to commence the proceedings to 7 May 2024.Dismiss theamendedsummons.The plaintiff is to pay the defendants’costs.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Imadethat orderin the Principal Judgment at [69(4)].The first defendant,Brandon Evertz, andthethirddefendant, Sonia Thurston, took different positions on Mr Corner’s application. As I noted in the Principal Judgment at [4],Mr Evertz consentedto the orders sought save insofar as they concerneddisclosure and costs, whereasMs Thurston opposedthose orders in relation to disclosure and costs and otherwise neither consentedto nor opposedthe balance of the orders sought.In the Principal Judgmentat [56]–[69],I found that Mr Corner should be relieved of the procedural requirements in the UCPR and Practice Note.Igranted Mr Corner liberty to apply tomake any application toseek relief from any requirement to serve expert or lay evidencefrom persons other than himandconcerningthe trial of these proceedings.I also granted Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston liberty to applyonthreedays’noticeseeking disclosure from Mr Corner of any document or thing clearly identified in the notice to produceandrelevant to a fact in issue,provided thatsuch documents are not the books or records of Big Un orBig Reviewandarenot inthepossession, custody or control of Big Un, Big Reviewor their liquidators.The parties’respective positions on the question of costsoftheproceedingscan be summarised as follows:Mr Corner submits that Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston shouldbe ordered to payhis costs, as hewassuccessful in being relieved of the obligationsto comply withvariousprocedural requirements, principally that of providing disclosure, which was the central issue in dispute at the hearing.MrEvertzsubmits that the partiesshouldbear their own costs,because the only issue between them was that of Mr Corner providing disclosure, which was the subject of an important qualification at the hearing of the type sought by Mr Evertz.Ms Thurstonsimilarlysubmits that the partiesshouldbear their own costs and,alternatively,thatcosts shouldonlybe awarded in favour of Mr Cornerfrom 11 June 2024,the day Ms Thurston filed her notice of objection.In this judgment, I have determined the issue of costs in chambers, having regard to the parties’respective written submissions and evidence on which they each relied.For the reasons set out below,I have concluded thatMr Cornershouldreceivethe costs ofhisapplicationwith somepercentagereductionto reflect the mixed outcome ofit.RELEVANT FACTSIn addition to the relevant facts stated in the Principal Judgmentat [5]–[31], the following matters are also relevant to the exercise of my discretion on the issue of costs.On 18 April 2024, Mr Cornerfiledthenotice of motionseekinga stay of proceedings against himor,alternatively an order dispensing with any obligationunder theUCPRand Practice Notetofile a list response,pleadandprovide particulars, serve any evidence or provide any disclosure.

The agreed form of short minutes wasin the following form:1.Order that the fourth defendant, Andrew Scott Corner, be relieved of the requirements of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW) (UCPR) and Practice Note SC EQ Commercial List and Technology and Construction List (Practice Note) to:a.file and serve any commercial list response or other defence to the plaintiff’s commercial list statement filed on 7 November 2023 pursuant to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 14.3 of the UCPR;b.plead matters specifically pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 14.14 of the UCPR;c.provide particulars pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 15.1 of the UCPR;d.serve any evidence (other than expert evidence or evidence from persons other than the fourth defendant);

andb.concerning the trial of this proceeding.3.The Notice of Motion filed on 18 April 2024 is dismissed insofar as it concerns the plaintiff with no order as to costs.On 28 June 2024, Mr Evertz provided Mr Corner witha set ofproposed short minutes of order,stating as follows:…1.Thefourth defendant, Andrew Scott Corner, be relieved of the requirements of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW) (UCPR) and Practice Note SC EQ Commercial List and Technology and Construction List (Practice Note) to:a.file and serve any commercial list response or other defence to the plaintiff’s commercial list statement filed on 7 November 2023 pursuant to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 14.3 of the UCPR;b.plead matters specifically pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 14.14 of the UCPR;c.provide particulars pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Practice Note and/or rule 15.1 of the UCPR;

andb.concerning the trial of this proceeding.3.The Notice of Motion filed on 18 April 2024 is dismissed insofar as it concerns the first defendant with no order as to costs.4.The Court notes that should the first defendant issue a notice to produce or seek orders in respect of discovery from the fourth defendant, nothing contained in these orders prevents the fourth defendant from making an application to set aside any such notice to produce or oppose discovery at that time.5.Liberty to apply to vary these orders is granted.On 12 July 2024,the solicitor for Mr Corner,Kristyl Burnettof KB Legals, filed an affidavit in these proceedings(Burnett affidavit).Also on 12 July 2024, the hearing of the notice of motion took place, at whichtimethe Burnett affidavit was read.On19 July 2024,Idelivered the Principal Judgment and made ordersat [69], summarised as follows:Mr Corner be relieved of the requirements of the UCPR and PracticeNoteto file and serve any list response, plead matters, provide particulars, serve any evidence (other than expert evidence) and provide any disclosureexcept the books ofBig Unor Big Review, which are not otherwise in the possession, custody or control ofBig Unor Big Review or their liquidators.Mr Corner has liberty to apply to be relieved from any requirement to serve expert or lay evidence afterBig Unhas served its evidence andto make any applicationconcerningthe trial of the proceeding.Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston have liberty to apply for disclosure from Mr Corner of anyspecific document or thing that is clearly identified in the noticeto produceand is relevant to a fact in issue, provided that such documents are not the books or records ofBig Unor Big Review and otherwise not in the possession, custody or control ofBig Unor Big Review or their liquidators.Thenotice of motion filed 18 April 2024 is otherwise dismissed insofar as it concernsBig Unwith no order as to costs.The notice of motion filed 18 April 2024 is otherwise dismissed insofar as it concernsMr Evertz and Ms Thurston.The issue of costs as betweenMr Corner, andMr EvertzandMs Thurston, is reserved to be dealt with in chambers on the papers.On 26 July 2024, Mr Evertz, Ms Thurston and Mr Corner eachfiledtheir written submissions on the issue of costs.SUBMISSIONSSubmissions of Mr CornerIn summary, Mr Corner made the following submissions:Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston should pay Mr Corner’s costs of the motion, as Mr Corner succeeded in his application to secure the dispensation sought, despite Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston’s opposition at the hearing.This is the“event”that costs should follow in accordance with r 42.1 of the UCPR.Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston submitted that the court should not accede to Mr Corner’s application forin liminedispensation from obligations of disclosure. Contrary to those submissions, the court found that Mr Corner“should be relievedin limineof all of the requirements upon him imposed by the court processes to…give disclosure”: Principal Judgment at [59].Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston challenged the degree of overlap between these proceedings and the Criminal proceedings. The court accepted Mr Corner’s submission that there was a general and specific overlap between the two proceedings and that in any event, there is no requirement for a complete overlap: Principal Judgment at [58], [60].Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston submitted that Mr Corner’s application for dispensation from obligations of disclosure was premature. Mr Corner also succeededon that issue, with the court finding,contrary to theirsubmissions, that the application was not premature or too broad: Principal Judgment at [63].In those circumstances, Mr Corner has prevailed and should have his costs.Submissions of Mr EvertzIn summary, Mr Evertz made the following submissions:Theproposedshort minutes providedon 28 June 2024 by Mr Evertzto Mr Corner were in the terms agreed with Big Un, subject to the removal of order 1(e) and the introduction of a notation that Mr Corner wasat libertyto seek to set aside any notice to produce or application for discovery by Mr Evertz. These short minutes confirm that the only issue ever in dispute with Mr Evertz was the question of disclosure, as Mr Evertz sought to ensure that he was not shut out from seeking documents from Mr Corner if needed.Mr Corner’s case for dispensationfromdisclosure was clearly articulated for the first time on the date of the hearing, 12 July 2024, by the Burnett affidavit and oral submissions of his counsel. The issue of prejudice arising from disclosure was, before that time, the subject of one paragraph of Mr Corner’s written submissions and no specific evidence.This court made orders dispensing with any requirement for Mr Corner to give disclosure subject totwoqualifications: that it did not extend to the books of Big Un orBig Review; and Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston have liberty to apply for disclosure from Mr Corner of specific documents or things not inthepossession of Big Un.The first qualification was agreed, in substance, between Mr Corner and Big Un on 13 June 2024, but Mr Corner’s position in relation to extending that concession to Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston fluctuated during the hearing (T34.37–39.8).The second qualification was not agreed, as it was only at the hearing that Mr Corner accepted that Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston should have liberty to apply as an appropriate qualification to his dispensation from disclosure. This qualification protects, albeit in a narrow form, Mr Evertz’s concern and reason for opposing order 1(e).The dispute between Mr Evertz and Mr Corner crystallised for the first time on 11 June 2024 and was limited to the issue of dispensation from any disclosure obligations and was resolved subject to a significant qualification to protect Mr Evertz’s position that was not conceded by Mr Corner until the hearing.The parties should bear their own costs. On any view, there could be no question of Mr Evertz’s liability for Mr Corner’s costs incurred prior to 11 June 2024.Submissions of Ms ThurstonIn summary, Ms Thurston made the following submissions:The parties should bear their own costs for three reasons.First, Mr Corner only had partial success on the notice of motion. The original form of the notice of motion sought, asits primary relief, a stay of the proceedings and only in the alternative dispensation from various procedural obligations. Mr Corner subsequently agreed with Big Un onproposedconsent orders on 13 June 2024, so that he no longer pressed a stay and the disclosure obligation in order 2(e) was modified to a highly caveated version. The orders made in the Principal Judgment further qualified that dispensation by granting Ms Thurston and Mr Evertz liberty to apply to seek disclosure of specified documents, which was sought in Ms Thurston’s written submissions on the notice of motion and only conceded by counsel for Mr Corner at the hearing itself (T13.49, 14.43, 40.30). The procedural history shows that the scope of eventual dispute was relatively minor and the final form of orders contained a compromise position.Secondly, there was a key contradiction in Mr Corner’s position in relation to the proffered carveout for disclosure of the books and records of Big Un and Big Review. The concession was pressed in Mr Corner’s written submissions, but withdrawn by hiscounsel during the hearing, so that Mr Corner’s position shifted back to seeking unqualified relief from any disclosure (T38.35–50), which was ultimately not ordered by this court.Thirdly, one of the bases of Ms Thurston’s notice of objection to order 2(e) was that Mr Corner had not provided any good reason to justify why he should be relieved from the obligation to provide disclosure and no evidence“specifically”addressed why a disclosure obligation in the future would be contrary to his right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination. This gap was only resolved the day of the hearing by thelate service of the Burnett affidavit on 12 July 2024, weeks after the deadline for any reply evidence of 7 June 2024 and hours before the hearing. The“essential problem for Mr Corner”that I considered in the PrincipalJudgment at [64]—being that responding in any way to a request for documents would put him at risk in the criminal proceedings by exposing his knowledge—was only articulated in Mr Corner’s evidence for the first time by the Burnett affidavit.If I am not minded to make an order that the parties bear their own costs, then alternatively, costs should only be awarded in favour of Mr Corner from 11 June 2024,being the date of Ms Thurston’s notice of objection. Prior to 11 June 2024, Ms Thurston had communicated no position on the notice of motion, the main contradictor was Big Un (until the service of the short minutes of order on 13 June 2024) and Mr Corner’s primary relief sought by the notice of motion was a stay of the proceedings against him (which was not ultimately ordered).LEGAL PRINCIPLESSection 98(1)of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW)(CPA)provides:(1)Subject to rules of court and to this or any other Act—(a)costs are in the discretion of the court, and(b)the court has full power to determine by whom, to whom and to what extent costs are to be paid, and(c)the court may order that costs are to be awarded on the ordinary basis or on an indemnity basis.The discretion to award costs under s 98 of the CPA is broad and the section itself is to be construed liberally:Oshlack v Richmond River Council(1998) 193 CLR 72; [1998] HCA 11, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [21]. The discretion is, however, subject to the rules of court, being the UCPR. It is therefore necessary to consider whether there are any rulesthatwould impact on the exercise of that discretion.Rule 42.1 of the UCPR states:Subject to this Part, if the court makes any order as to costs, the court is to order that the costs follow the event unless it appears to the court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.Recently, inChandrasekaran v Western Sydney Local Health District (t/as Westmead Hospital)(No 2)[2024] NSWCA 21, the Court of Appeal of this court (constituted by Gleeson, Leeming and Adamson JJA) gave an explanation of the normal rule, stating at [11]–[12]:[11]Costs are in the broad discretion of the Court with the general rule being that they should follow the “event”: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 42.1. Generally, the “event” refers to the event of the claim and may be understood as referring to the practical result of a particular claim:Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd v Lovick & Son Developments Pty Ltd (No 2)[2014] NSWCA 219 at [15].[12]Underlying both the general rule that costs follow the event, and the qualifications to that rule, is the idea that costs should be paid in a way that is fair, having regard to what the Court considers to be the responsibility of each party for the incurring of costs:Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Gretton[2008] NSWCA 117 at [121] (Hodgson JA, Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing).InCroc’s Franchising Pty Ltd v Alamdo Holdings Pty Ltd(No 3)[2023] NSWCA 316, Basten AJA, and Payne and Stern JJA, observed similarly at [7]:… Under r 42.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) the “general rule” is that the court is to order that costs follow the event. The “event” may be characterised in more than one way. Generally the “event” refers to the result of the claim or counterclaim, as the case may be, and may be understood as referring to the practical result of a particular claim:Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd v Lovick & Sons Developments Pty Ltd (No 2)[2014] NSWCA 219 at [15] (Ward, Emmett and Gleeson JJA). …Their Honours also addressed the approach to be taken in“mixed outcome”cases, stating at [7]:Where there has been a mixed outcome in the proceedings, and it is appropriate to entertain the process of apportioning costs as between different issues in the proceedings, in general such an exercise will be carried out on a relatively broad brush basis, and largely as a matter of impression and evaluation by the court:Doppstadtat [19];James v Surf Road Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2)[2005] NSWCA 296 at [36];Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings PtyLtd (No 3)(1998) 30 ACSR 20 at 22;Mahaffey v Mahaffey(2018) 97 NSWLR 119; [2018] NSWCA 42 at [275].InLoureiro v Mac Aus UnitPty Ltd(No 3)[2022] NSWSC 358, Gleeson J at[19]–[20] considered the“essential issue”of how mixed success should be reflected in an order for costs:[19]The Court does not usually award costs on an issue-by-issue basis. However, some adjustment may be made if an otherwise successful party fails on an issue which is clearly dominant or separable, or there is otherwise good reason to make some adjustment to the costs order. The principles are stated inBostik Australia Pty Ltd v Liddiard (No 2)[2009] NSWCA 304 at [38] . See also:Cellarit Pty Ltd v Cawarrah Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2)[2018] NSWCA 266 at [10]–[14] .[20]Where there has been a mixed outcome in the proceedings, and it is appropriate to entertain the process of apportioning costs as between different issues in the proceedings, in general such an exercise will be carried out on a relatively broad brush basis, and largely as a matter of impression and evaluation by the Court:Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd v Lovick & Son Developments Pty Ltd (No 2)[2014] NSWCA 219 at [19], citingJames v Surf Road Nominees Pty Ltd (No 2)[2005] NSWCA 296 at [36];Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3)(1998) 30 ACSR 20 at 22 .InGalativ Deans (No 2)[2019]NSWSC 1714,WardCJ in Eq(asthe Presidentthen was)at [41]–[42]drew a distinction between the principles applicable in relation to the exercise ofthediscretion as to costs where there are multiple issues and a mixed outcomeon the same issue,eventuallyconcluding that the same approach should be taken in the face of either, saying:[41]Where there are multiple issues, then it may be appropriate to make costs orders apportioning costs as between the various issues though (as noted inGalati v Deans (No 3)) there are a number of authorities that advocate caution before so doing. Here, the situation is not one of a multitude of issues, but rather a mixed outcome on the only substantive issue in dispute by the time of the hearing of the notice of motion…[42]As I have noted inGalati v Deans (No 3), where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings the question of apportionment is very much a matter of discretion and mathematical precision is illusory; it being dependent onmatters of impression and evaluation (seeDodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd(1993) 26 IPR 261 (at [38])), per Gummow, French and Hill JJ at [272]) (as cited by the Court of Appeal inJames v Surf Road Nominees PtyLtd(No 2)[2005] NSWCA 296 (at [36]) and again inBostik Australia Pty Ltd v Liddiard(No 2)[2009] NSWCA 304 )). I would adopt the sameapproach to the assessment of costs where there has been a mixed outcome albeit on the same issue.CONSIDERATIONOn one view, this would appear to be a case in which Mr Corner has made a successful application to be relieved of the procedural requirementsin the UCPRandthePractice Note forfiling a response, providing pleadings and particulars, serving lay evidence and providing disclosure. But that is a simplistic view of what has occurred.The only real opposition to the application was that of Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston in relation to disclosure. On that issue, Mr Corner was not wholly successful because of the qualifications to it which werefinallyordered. Those qualifications were first introduced in the proposed consent orders agreed with Big Un on 13 June 2024, which made an exception to disclosure forthe books ofBig Un andBig Review. Then the final form of orders in the Principal Judgment included a further qualification by grantingMr Evertz and Ms Thurston liberty to apply for disclosure from Mr Corner of any specific document or thing that is clearly identified in the notice to produce and is relevant to a fact in issue, provided that such documents are not the books or records ofBig Unor Big Review and otherwise not in the possession, custody or control ofBig Unor Big Review or their liquidators.The latter qualification did not emerge until the hearing on 12 July 2024.Like inGalati,this is a situation involving mixed success on one substantive issue in dispute, being whether Mr Corner should be relieved from the procedural requirement of disclosure.While Mr Corner has had success in being relieved from complying with the procedural requirements in these proceedings,it was not complete success.I consider that in the exercise of my discretion,I mustweighmatters of impression and evaluation.I should recognise that Mr Corner successfully arguedsubstantive issueswhich were raisedby Mr Evertz and Ms Thurstonin oppositionto the application for relief from disclosure other than thequalifications which I allowed. The substantive“event”was the relief from disclosure which I granted in favour of Mr Corner, which entitles him to a costs award in his favour, but that award should be tempered by a percentage reduction to recognise that Mr Corner did not obtain the complete relief which he sought.In my assessment, the extent of Mr Corner’s success can be dealt with in abroad-brushway by ordering that each of Mr Evertz and Ms Thurston should pay 80% of Mr Corner’s costs of the notice of motion.ORDERSFor the reasons expressed above, I propose to make the following order:The first and third defendants are to pay 80% of the fourth defendant’s costs of the notice of motion filed 18 April 2024.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Because the motions deal with subpoenas and discovery,and there are objections to the subpoena and issues associated with the costs of the subpoena, it is necessary to deal with the substantive proceedings briefly.The plaintiff is the father of NathanGazal(hereinafter“Nathan”). Nathan is engaged to the second defendant,Oezlem(Shirin)Topaloglu. The second defendant, in turn, isafriendof(and,for certain periods,aco-workerof) the first defendant (FransiscaSetiawan).The plaintiff is alsothefatherofNasriGazal(hereinafter“Nasri”). Nasri’s mother, who is the plaintiff’s ex-wife, is TheresaGazal(hereinafter“Theresa”).RabiaaElSamadi(aka“Ruby”), who is a witness in the plaintiff’s case, is the plaintiff’s current wife.The plaintiff in these proceedings is a defendant in other proceedings brought bytheDeputy Commissioner of Taxation (DCT)and various liquidators.In this proceeding, the plaintiff alleges that he gave the first defendant an amount of $800,000incashand six luxury watches (valued at $698,808.31).The plaintiff brings claims in bailment and conversion against the defendants. The claims are concerned with (i) $800,000 cash and (ii) six luxury watches, which the plaintiff alleges he provided to the first defendant for safekeeping. The items were stored in a safety deposit box in the name of both defendants.The parties have served their evidence in chief in the case. The plaintiff has served his evidence in reply. The main proceedings are set down for trial in September 2024 for 10 days. There are 10 witnesses who have deposed affidavits.The parties are currently preparing expert evidence,and the current expectation of the parties is that each of the witnesses will be the subject of cross-examination.On 5 December 2022, the plaintiff obtained an AntonPiller[1]order,which was served the next day, 6 December 2022. Execution of the AntonPillerorder resulted in data being extracted by the plaintiff’s expert (MrYianSun ofCyterPty Ltd and MrMcKemmish) from mobile telephones owned by the first and second defendants. The defendants claimed privilege over documents within the extracted data.On 8 December 2022, Yehia J ordered that the digital material be seized.The plaintiff has filed 12Notices ofMotion in the proceedings.Sixof those applications were set for hearing on 14 February 2024. The defendants have filed two applications.On 1 November 2023, associates of the plaintiff filed four Notices of Motion seeking their claimed costs for compliance with four subpoenas for production issued by the defendants. The applicants on those applications areRuby,Nasriand Theresa. It is appropriate, at this point, to recite that WE 1 Pty Ltd(hereinafter“Watch Exchange”)is the company that, according to the plaintiff, allegedly sold watches to the plaintiff,which the plaintiff claims were converted by the defendants. The applicants unsuccessfully applied to set aside the subpoenas.[2]The plaintiff seeks, by motion, subject to an amended notice filed on 18October 2023, for the Court to appoint a referee in respect to theExtractedCommunications. This motion will be referred to as“the referee motion”. By the term Extracted Communication,the Court is referring to the communications to which Yehia J referred in her Honour’s orders of 8December 2022. Those communications are all message communicationthreads including, but not limited to, emails, text messages and WhatsApp communication threads sent to or from the first defendant’s mobile phone between 1 July 2022 and 6 December 2022.Further, the plaintiff seeks discovery by motion, notice for which was filed on 11November 2023. It should be noted that, in relation to the Extracted Communications, her Honour ordered that an expert (Mr Sun) provide to the first defendant’s solicitors copies of the Extracted Communications and that the aforesaid solicitors provide to the solicitors for the plaintiff“all Extracted Communications…which relate to the envelopes, cash or watches, the subject of the proceedings, excluding those communications over which the first defendant claims legal professional privilege”.Beech-Jones CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) issued orders to the same effect relating to the second defendant. Those later orders were issued on 16December 2022,and the expert named in those orders was MrMcKemmish.The defendants move on two motions, one for which notice was filed and served on 27 October 2023,in which a variation is sought of the freezing orders made on 5 December 2022 in order to remove the cap that was placed on legal expenditure, including expenditure for this proceeding; and the second, for which notice was filed on 7 August 2023 seeking to set asidethesubpoena issued to the defendants’solicitor.As already stated, Watch Exchange, seeks$3,465 for the costs of compliance with the subpoena issued to it on 18 August 2023,andthecosts of the motion on an indemnity basis. Nasri seeks costs of $4,015 as compensationfor compliancewith the subpoena issued on 18 August 2023. Ruby seeks costs of $6,875 for complying with the subpoena issued to her on 18 August 2023.Theresa seeks compliance costs of $6,875 as compensation for the costs of complying with the subpoena issued to her on 18 August 2023. Each of thesubpoena-costsapplicants seeks indemnity costs for the motions filed in relation to such costs.Apart from the pleadings, which are before the Court, the plaintiff relies upon the affidavits of Claudette Gazisworn4 July 2023, 18 October2023and 8September 2023.Watch Exchange relies on the affidavits of Claudette Gazisworn23 October 2023 and 22 December 2023.Nasri relies on the affidavits of Claudette Gazi sworn 23 October 2023 and 22December2023.Ruby relies onthe affidavits of Claudette Gazi sworn 23 October 2023 and 22December 2023. Therese relies on the affidavits of Claudette Gazi sworn 23 October 2023 and 22 December 2023.The applicants also rely upon the affidavit of Claudette Gazi filed 1 November 2023 and the affidavit of Samantha Jade Langan of 27 November 2023.The defendant relies on its Defence to the Amended Statement of Claim of 12May 2023,and theaffidavits of Samantha Jade Langan of 31 January 2024 and 23 November 2023 and 16 December 2022 (the last mentioned not having been filed); the affidavit of Claudette Gazi of 9 February 2024; Elias ElKhoury of 15 September 2023 and 7 August 2023;OezlemTopalogluof 15December 2022; andFransiscaNatalia Setiawan of 15 December 2022.Leaving aside for present purposes the application for costsin answering the subpoenas, the issue between the parties is the adequacy and/or compliance with the orders already made by Yehia J,and the requirement to obtain documents that are said to be known to exist,but which may require formal proof,and therefore may require a party to provide it in formal answer to subpoena or on discovery.Ordinarily, compliance with an order of the Court,and, in particular, compliancewith subpoenas, is not dealt with by the issuing of further orders, the effect of which is to providethe samedocuments or some documentsthat are the same. Non-compliance or inadequate compliance with an order for production, whether it be a subpoena or discovery, is dealt with by testing the affidavit and/or answer to the order and/or an order for compliance of a more formal kind.[3]Nevertheless, the Court is faced with the application which seeks tofacilitate the production of the document in question, amongst other things, by the appointment of a referee and/or expert to obtain the document and copy it.DiscoveryInitially, the motion for discovery was a prayer for discovery in certain categories. After discussion between the parties, it was agreed that there be mutual general discovery, subject to the approval of the Court.Pursuant to the overriding purposeof theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW), which requires the parties and the Court to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues between the parties, and, in particular, the requirement to facilitate the proposition that costs in proceedings should not be disproportionate to that which is in issue, it is an exceptional course for the Court to order general discovery. Often, general discovery involves significant additional costs in unnecessary circumstances.In the proceedings before the Court, the parties have an agreement that general discovery should occur. The Court, as presently constituted, is not satisfied thatthemere agreement of the parties amounts to exceptional circumstances.Nevertheless, this justiciable controversy has a long history with many interlocutory applications. Given the history of the matter and the attitude of the parties, it is most probable that any discovery by category would invite fine distinctions and arguments as to whether a document was properly categorised and sought.Inall ofthe circumstances,including the consent of the parties, the Court is satisfied that general discovery in these proceedings, given the confined factual controversy between the parties, will expedite the proceedings to a greater extent than discovery by categories and will reduce the burden of costs, rather than increase them.Inallthe circumstances, theCourt is satisfied mutual general discovery should be ordered.Appointment of RefereeAs can be seen from the immediately preceding paragraph, the Court is ordering general discovery. As a consequence of that general discovery, any document on the phone of any partythatisadjectivally relevant to the proceedings, including any and all of the Extracted Communications, will be discoverable.In accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (hereinafter“UCPR”)r.21.3(2), discovery must be by a list of documents in three parts. The list of discovered documents needs to be in two parts: one being the list of documents in the possession of the party giving discovery; andthesecond list being the list of documents that were within the last six months in the possession of the party but are no longer in the possession. In relation to the second of those lists, it is necessary to set out in whose possession the party believes the document to be. The third list, or part of the discovered list, is the documents that are privileged,which must be describedsufficiently, together with the circumstances that give rise to the privilege, sothatthe party receiving the documentis ableto understand the claim for privilege.Failure to comply with an order for discovery, once ordered, wouldbe contempt, which may involve significant criminal punishment. In those circumstances, the need for a referee to extract and produce a document that is otherwisenowrequired tobe discovered seems unnecessary and inconsistent with the facilitation of the“cheap”resolution of the issues between the parties. Even though the factual controversy between the parties is within short compass, there are 10 witnesses from whom evidence will be adduced,and as is clear from the affidavits and submissions,thecredit of one or other of the parties will be in issue.Nevertheless, the documents relating to these transactions,and thatwhichmaybe adjectivally relevant to the issues before the Court, should not be of such vast quantities that the Court should do otherwise than order the general discovery.While the credit of one or more of the parties looms large in the proceedings, in and of itself, such a circumstance does not compel an order for the appointment of a referee or expert to extract a document that is now the subject of discovery.Costs of Compliance to SubpoenasAn examination of the costs associated with the subpoenas disclosed that each of the recipientsof animpugned subpoena sought legal advice and instructed the solicitor to copy and serve/file the documents in answer to the subpoena. The Court is not satisfied that legal advice was a reasonable reaction to the service of the subpoena.It has not been suggested in the motion before the Court that the subpoenas were a fishing exercise nor that the documents sought were other thanthat which wasadjectivally relevant to the proceedings. The terms of the subpoena do not require the independent assessment of documents as would be required, possibly, for discovery. The recipients of the subpoenas are not parties to the proceedings.In the foregoing circumstances, it is not reasonable to seek legal advice. The demand for production was in relation to documents that are, as earlier stated, described in a straightforward manner. Nor is there any issue relating to privilege.[4]InDovico, Young AJ said:“There is strong authority that a person who receives a subpoena may claim the cost of getting legal advice: see for exampleHadid vLenfestCommunications Inc(1996) 65 FCR 350; 144 ALR 73. However, I affirm what I said inTriotasPty Ltd vRohn(Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 20 May 1993), that this depends on whether it was reasonable to seek the advice and that a person who receives a straightforward demand to produce a document would not be justified in first going to a lawyer to get advice. Nonetheless, in the present case, because of the legal professional privilege question, it may well have been appropriate to obtain counsel’s advice. On the other hand, solicitors are presumed to know the law. TheAssociate Judge will have to decide what was reasonable in all the circumstances of this case.”[5]InFranklins Pty Ltd v Endeavour Holdings Pty Ltd[6], Pembroke J said:“The costs of legal advice may be recoverable under [UCPR] Rule 33.11 but only where it is reasonable to seek that advice. A person who receives a straightforward demand to produce documents, to which no issues of privilege or confidentiality attach, is not justified in recovering the costs of first going to a lawyer to obtain advice.”[7]Given that the documents were in the possession of each of the applicants on these motions, it is even less reasonablethento subcontract to a solicitor the photocopying and delivery of documents that are otherwise straightforward,that arenot reasonablyexpected to be privileged or confidential andthatcould have been produced by the recipient of the subpoena itself. In those circumstances, the additional costs, all of which are costs of the solicitor, are not allowed.It is appropriate, at this stage, to deal also with the issue associated with the subpoena issued against the solicitor for the defendants. If the solicitorisin possession of documents (as broadly defined) which are not privileged and which are held as the solicitor for the defendants, then such documents would be discoverable and would,and should,be listed with the other documents that are discoveredas a consequence ofthe earlier ruling. On the other hand, if the solicitor to whom the subpoenawasissued,wasin possessionof material from other clients, a privilege attaches. In my view, the subpoena to the solicitor is either unnecessary or inappropriate. The Court will strike out the subpoena.Freezing OrdersThe defendants are subject to a freezing order,which allows them to pay lawyersupto a limit of $30,000. The Court is not here concerned with theappropriateness of the freezing order in the proceedings before the Court. Rather, the Court is concerned with the reasonableness of the $30,000 limit.As earlier stated, the substantive proceedings are listed for 10 days. The $30,000 limit is wholly inadequate,assuming legal fees at the lowest possible level. Apart from the numerous motions filed by the plaintiff,which have occasioned costs, the defendants are required to prepare and to run the hearing when it comes before the Court.The freezing orders were obtainedexparte,and it is clear from the material in the file and before the Court on these applications that the work that has been done so far is extensive.It is my firm view, in the circumstances, that a $30,000 limiton reasonablelegal fees is unfairtothedefendants andhas an impact on their capacity to prepare andtopresent their case.On this aspect of the motions before the Court, the plaintiff has sought copies of the invoices of the solicitors for the defendants. It would be wholly unnecessary,andnotin keeping with the overriding purpose of theCivil Procedure Act, for the Court to insist upon evidence of something that is so manifestly obvious. The defendants seek variation of the orders of the Court, issued by Yehia J, so that the limit would relate to“reasonable costs”without a monetary cap. In the circumstances, andin light of the fact thatthe hearing will occur in thenot-too-distantfuture, it seems to the Court that some cap should be placed upon the reasonable costs that may be paid to legal representatives.In the absenceofa determination by a Costs Assessor, there is no independent evaluation of that which is said to be“reasonable”. In those circumstances, there should be some limit, which will encompass at least the costs that have been incurred so farand some measure of the costs of the10 dayhearing. Beyond that,thefreezing order will expire at the time that the proceedings are determined.It seems appropriate for the limit on the freezing order expenses to be $250,000.ConclusionFor the foregoing reasons, the Court makes the following orders:The Court dismisses the motion of the plaintiff, notice of which was filed on 4 July 2023 and amended by notice filed on 18 October2023;The Court sets aside the subpoena issued toFrancomLegal Pty Ltd issued by theplaintiff;The Court variesclause 10(b) of the freezing order issued by Yehia J in these proceedings by deleting the sum of“$30,000.00”and inserting in lieu thereof the sum of“$250,000.00”;The Court orders that each party give general discovery within 10days of the date of thisorder;Costs of the motions will be costs in thecause;Pursuant to the earlier reasons delivered today ex tempore, order 4 above is stayed until further order of thecourt.Endnotes1.Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Ltd [1976] Ch 53.2.Gazal v Setiawan [2023] NSW SC 923 at [91]–[122].3.See for example Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (“UCPR”) Rule 33.12.4.Re Dovico; Ex Parte Mayne Wetherall [2012] NSWSC 822.5.Ibid, at [54]6.Franklins Pty Ltd v Endeavour Holdings Pty Ltd [2013] NSW SC 1204.7.Ibid, at [9] (Pembroke J).DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The resolution of some justiciable controversies exemplifies that description better than others.The controversy between the parties has a very long history and concerns costs. The plaintiff, Mr John David Bingham (hereinafter“the Solicitor”),is a Solicitor. The Solicitor briefed the defendant, Mr Christopher Bevan (hereinafter“the Barrister”).On 16 September 2019, the Solicitor entered into a Costs Agreement with EvangelinaKessly(hereinafter“the Client”) and the Barrister, whom the Solicitor engaged as Counselto appear forthe Client.It was an express term of the Costs Agreement that the Solicitor would only become liable fortheBarrister’s fees once the Solicitor was put into the necessary funds by the Client.On 29 July 2020, the Barrister filed an application for costs assessment. CostsCertificates were initially issued in November 2020, and on 10 December 2020, the Barrister sought a review of thoseCostsCertificates.As a result of the review, two Certificates of Determination of the Barrister’s costs were issued on 16 April 2021. Those Certificates of Determination are central to the issue between the parties now before the Court.The Barrister again sought to challenge theCostsCertificates. The latest challenge wasinthis Court,and the proceedings were dismissed.On 9 February 2023, the Barrister notified the Solicitor that he intended to register theCostsCertificates as judgments of the Court for enforcement against the Solicitor.On 14 February 2023, the Solicitor obtained an interim injunction, restrainingthe Barrister from taking further action.On 17 February 2023, the Solicitor filed a Statement of Claim seeking final declarations.On 16 March 2023, the Barrister filed a Defence.Relevantly, and concurrently with this matter, a related and similar matter proceeded betweenthe Solicitor and the Barrister regarding costs in another matter in which the client was a MrBoensch(hereinafter“theBoenschmatter”).In relation to theBoenschmatter, Walton J of this Court had given Judgment on 12 September 2022, affirming the Barrister’s right to register hisCostsCertificate. The Solicitor appealed the judgment,and the Court of Appeal upheld the Appeal on 5 May 2023. The Court of Appeal delivered itsjudgment after the commencement of the proceedings now before the Court.The Barrister applied for Special Leave to appeal the Judgment of the Court of Appeal to the High Court. Leave was refused on 7 September 2023.Because of the result of the proceedings,and the determination of the principles associated with the same or almost identical Costs Agreements, many issues otherwisecontentiousin theBoenschmatter were resolved by agreement in the matter now before the Court.Open offers have been made in which the Barrister, in effect, consented to declaratory relief being granted. The only dispute between the partieswasthe issue of costs and the terms of the appropriate orders. The issue of the costs order needs more explanation.Further, since the original drafting of these reasons, the Solicitor has received funds from the Client, which hassignificantly alteredthe prayers for relief.The Costs Agreement between the Barrister and Solicitor has two clauses that require reciting, being clauses 4 and 7. They are in the following terms:“4. The Solicitor’s liability for the payment of fees under this agreement is conditional upon him recovering the Barrister’s fees from either theClient or the respondent to the appeal…to the intent that the Solicitor will only be liable for the Barrister’s fees under this agreement to the extent that one or more of those parties has put him into the necessary funds to pay the Barrister’s fees. However, liability to pay the Barrister’s fees is not otherwise dependent upon the success of the proceedings which is the subject of thiscostsagreement.7. Subject to paragraph 4 above, the Solicitor’s obligations under this agreement are personal to him. The Solicitor is liable to the Barrister for his fees rather than the Client being liable. The Solicitor will use his best endeavours at his expense to recover the Barrister’s fees from either the Client or the respondent to theappeal,…, expeditiously, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings which are the subject of this costs agreement and the Brief.”[1]After an initial costs assessment, a Review Panel determined that neither the Barrister’s nor the Solicitor’s conduct was in accordance with theLegal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014(NSW). The reasonfornon-compliance is currently irrelevant.As a consequence, the Review Panel assessed the costs owing on the basis of that which was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.[2]In theBoenschmatter, at first instance,the Court registered the Costs Certificates and, pursuant to the legislation, theCostsCertificates became Judgments of the Court.On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined that the provisions of theLegal Profession Uniform Law(NSW)did not render the Costs Agreement void for all purposes under s 178(1)(a) of the statute,and that the provisions of s 185(2) of the relevant statute disentitled a practitionerfrom recoveringan amount in excess of the amount it would have been entitled to recover if the Costs Agreement had not been void.Consequently, the Court of Appeal determined that, because the Costs Agreement did not entitle the Barrister to recovercostsfrom the Solicitor until the Solicitor hadreceivedfundsfromthe Client, the Barrister could not obtainJudgment for that which was the subject of theCostsCertificate until such time as the Solicitor had receivedsaidfunds from the Client.[3]The Court, as presently constituted, is bound by the determination of the Court of Appeal, which has construed the provisions of s 185 of theLegal Profession Uniform Lawto apply not only to the amount that may be owing but alsotothe conditions upon which payment would otherwise be made. As earlier stated,SpecialLeave to appeal that Judgment was refused.EvidenceThe plaintiff relies on the evidence contained in theaffidavit of John Bingham of 10 February 2023. Aspreviouslystated, Mr Bingham is the Solicitor and plaintiff in the proceedings. Theaffidavit outlines the entry into the Costs Agreement as particularised in the Statement of Claim, as well as the procedural history that has been summarised above in these reasons.The Solicitor, in hisaffidavit, testifies that he has not yet been put into funds by the Client. He has requestedthepaymentof fundspursuant to the certificates.On 6 August 2024, the Solicitor informed the Court that the Client (or the Trustee in Bankruptcy) had paid funds to the Solicitor.The defendant relies upon threeaffidavits of Christopher Bevan dated 16 June 2023, 27 July 2023,and 18 September 2023. The first two affidavits set out the procedural history of the matter and the Barrister’s identification of the facts,which, at the time of the affidavits,were sworn, the Barrister believed supported his defence.In the affidavit of 18 September 2023, which followed the refusal ofSpecialLeave by the High Court,the Barristerdeposes that, prior to the refusalof Special Leave, he believed that he had a right to register what he calls“the principalKesslycertificate”for his fees as well as the“subsidiaryKesslycertificate”, for the amount paid bythe Barristerto the manager of the costs assessmentagainst the Solicitor.The Barrister, in his affidavit, justifies the view held on the basis that, in theBoenschmatter, Walton J had dismissed an application by theSolicitorseeking the same relief which was sought in this matter over a Costs Agreement which was in the same terms. The Court of Appeal reversed the Judgment of WaltonJ in theBoenschmatter on 5 May 2023, which was after Garling J had granted the interim injunction in this matter.The Barrister filed his application for Special Leave in respect of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal on 7 August 2023 and that request was denied on 7September 2023.On 12 September 2023, the Barrister, through his solicitors, wrote to the Solicitor’s solicitor, indicating thatin light ofthe High Court’s decision, he would like to resolve these proceedings. An open offer was made with proposed orders to dispose of the proceedings.The open offer was the catalyst for an exchange of communication between the parties in which the Barrister sought to“refine”the declaratory orders sought. The only issuesthat then remainedweretheterms of the orders to be made and the issue of costs.SubmissionsThe Solicitor submits that the twoCostsCertificates, which are currently the subject of dispute, must each be dealt with separately. As to the first certificate issued for the Barrister’s fees, the Solicitor says that the Barristerwas not entitled to payment of the fees and wouldnot be until suchtimeas the Solicitor is put into funds by the Client. The Solicitor relies on the Court of Appeal Judgment in theBoenschmatter to that effect.As to the second certificate,withrespect totheapproximately $2,000 paid by the Barrister to the Costs Assessment Review Panel, the Solicitor says that theBarristeris not entitled to register that certificate. The Solicitor says that the certificate is only registerable by the manager of Costs Assessments and relies on the provisions of s71 of theLegal Profession Uniform Law Application Act2014(NSW)and s 133(2)of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW) together with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (hereinafter“UCPR”) and, in particular, UCPRrule 36.10.The Solicitor,therefore,submitted at the time of the hearingthat the Court should make the declaratory relief sought in the Statement of Claim.The Barrister submits that he is, subject to some wording changes, content for the orders in Prayer 1 to be granted. The proposedchanges relate to funds received not only from the Client,but also paid on her behalf.The Barrister submits that these changes are necessary to reflect properly the effect of s 185 of theLegal Profession Uniform Lawand the Judgment of the Court of Appeal. As to Prayer 2, the Barrister formally abandons his right to seek reimbursement of that amount entirely. The Barrister proposes that the orders made by the Court reflect that undertaking and submits that he acceptsthatit would beagainst the provisions of theCivil Procedure Actfor him to pursue the Solicitor for ade minimisdebt in a superior Court.As to costs, the Barrister submits that there should be no order as to costs. He states that he hasacted reasonably at all times, including promptlyconceding the plaintiff’s rights following the High Court’s refusal ofSpecialLeave. The Barrister relies upon the decision intheMinister for Immigration; exparteLai Qin[4],to the effect that in the absence of a hearing on the merits, the Court should not embark on a hypothetical trial to determine the issue of costs,and if it appears that both parties have acted reasonably, no order as to costs should be made.In reply, the Solicitor does not accept the additional wording in the orders proposed by the Barrister as being either necessary or appropriate. The Solicitor submits that the effect of Prayer 1 is directed towards the act of registering the Costs Agreement,andthatthe issue of part payments is not an issue in these proceedings.As to Prayer 2, the Solicitor submits that the Barrister’s proposed undertaking“seems disingenuous”. If the Barrister perceives that he has a cause of action open to him, even in respect of anyde minimisdebt, hewouldtake proceedings to recover it. It is notabsolutely clearfrom the reply whether the Solicitor accepts the written abandonment or seeks the Court to make the order in Prayer 2.As to costs, the Solicitor submits that the Barrister initially defended the proceedings and has now capitulated.As a consequence,he relies upon the usual authorities but, in particular, theCommonwealth v Gretton[5]to the effect that the Barrister was resisting a claim to which the Solicitorwas entitled and, as such, the Barrister should bear the Solicitor’s costs.ConsiderationThe issues in these proceedings (and in theBoenschmatter) ariseas a consequence ofthe bankruptcy of theClient. It is likely that the Solicitor will be fully“put into funds”to some, albeit possibly minor, effect.Leaving aside for present purposes the effect of legislation on the Costs Agreements between the parties, Costs Agreements give rise to contractual obligations.The Court of Appealstatedthat the provisions of s 185 of thestatute prevented the Barrister from registering ajudgmentor obtaining ajudgmentfor the wholeof the amount owing in circumstances where the condition on payment had not been fulfilled. There is an obvious issue as to the effect of that limitation.The provisions of clause 4 and clause 7 are recited above. As is clear from the extract, the Solicitor’s obligations are personal and are notas agentof theClient. Nevertheless, the Solicitor’s liability is conditional,and the Solicitor“will only be liable for the Barrister’s fees…to the extent that one…of…the parties has put into the necessary funds”.In other words, the obligation to pay is personal to the Solicitor,and the Solicitor is required to payas, andwhen,the Solicitor is put intofunds by theClient (or the respondent in thebriefedproceedings).The liability does not arise only at the point that the Solicitor is in receipt of sufficient funds to payall ofthe fees of the Barrister. Rather, the Solicitor is required to pay, from time to time,on receipt of the funds, referrable to the Barrister’s fees.Neither party has sought to agitate before the Court the circumstance that would apply if an amount were paid to the Solicitor and the amount was referrable to an invoice from the Solicitor that sought payment of fees payable to both the Solicitor and Barrister.The form of the order referrable toinPrayer 1 is a declaration that the defendant has no entitlement to register the Certificate of Determination as a Judgment until the plaintiff is put intofunds and, at least by implication, suggests“sufficient funds”. There can be little doubt that the entitlement of the Barrister under the Certificate of Determination of Review of 22 April 2021 to the full amount of over $220,000 does not exist until the amount has been paid into the Solicitor’s account to cover the debt.The difficulty is that the amount now owed, or which will be owed, no longer arisesunder contract. Rather, the condition precedent to the liability to pay the Barrister’s fees applies to the Solicitor, on the view expressed by the Court of Appeal,as a result ofthe application of s 185 and not as a result of the contractual obligation and/or limitation onanycontractual obligation.Technically, there is no contractual obligation to pay any amountas a result ofthe effect of the legislative scheme.Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal made clear, the description of a Costs Agreement in circumstances where there has been no or insufficient disclosure as“void”does not render the Costs Agreement void for all purposes, as if it never existed. As the terms of s 178(1)(b) and (c) make clear, the Costs Agreement is enforceable even though voidupto and including the amount that has been assessed fair and reasonable.On the other hand, if the Costs Certificate is registered as a Judgment of the Court, it is enforceable as a Judgment and does not depend upon contractual obligations. The term“void”was referred to by Windeyer J as a word that“has never been an easy word”andcommentedthat the use of the term does not necessarily mean that which is described as“void”has no legal effect.[6]The Judgment ofBastenAJ inBingham v Bevan,supra, is to the same effect.As a consequence, the Solicitor astheobligor is under a continuing obligation to theobligee, the Barrister, to pay that which is due and payable under the Costs Agreement,as,and when the Solicitor is“put into funds”in relation to the fees owing and to the extent that such funds are not greater than which has been certified as fair and reasonable. The law of contracts, it has been said, relates to the source of obligations, the basic principle of which is that the law of contracts seeks to enforce a promise to another in certain circumstances,e.g.,under seal or with consideration.I have little doubt that, if or when the Solicitor were“put into funds”in relation to the Barrister’s fees, the Solicitor would pay the amount to the Barrister. This is the obligation, subject to the statutory regime, to which he obliged himself.[7]On the other hand, a declaration of the kind sought by the Solicitor would require, in its terms, that the Solicitor receive the entirety of the amount underthe Certificate of Determination of Review before the Barrister could register the Certificate of Determination of Review. The difficulty with altering the provision is that a Certificate of Determination of Review (or a Costs Certificate), once registered, is a Judgment of the Court and, as earlier stated,canbe enforced as such.TheCostsCertificate does not seem to allow for registration of an amount less than that which has been certified. Further, once the Certificate of Determination of Review,or any Costs Certificate is registered, the amount certified therein, which forms part of the Judgment, creates a situation where any amountowingor debt would merge in the Judgment. This creates difficulties.First, it means that the Barrister cannot register the Certificate of Determination of Review in parts. Secondly, it meanssubject to the view that the statutory regime in describing the Costs Agreement as“void”does not have the effect of disentitling a legal practitioner from suing under the Costs Agreement up to the amount certified as fair and reasonable. The latter construction seems to accord best with the purpose of the legislation and harmonious operation of s185 of theLegal Profession Uniform Actwith the other provisions of the statute.The Barristerdidnot oppose the making of a declaration. The Barrister opposes a declaration in the form proposed. In those circumstances, a declarationwould havebeenissued, but not in the terms proposed for the reasons already outlined.However, as explained, the Solicitor is now“in funds”and does not, after 6 August 2024, seek the first declaration.I turn to the issues associated with Prayer 2. The Barrister suggests that the amount owing of $2,000isdeminimis. For the Barrister and the Solicitor, compared to the $220,000 otherwise owing, this may be so.It is difficult to suggest that $2,000 isde minimisin any other sense. Nevertheless, the Barrister has warranted that he would“waive”or“withdraw”the claim. It is a claim for the fees paid by the Barrister to the Costs Assessor on behalf of the Solicitor. The Solicitor describes the“waiver”or“warranty”as“disingenuous”.While I accept that the attitude of the Barrister may be arrived at reluctantly, the Court is not prepared to suggest that the Barrister would do otherwise than abide by the waiver or warranty proffered. The Barrister is an officer of the Court.Nothing in these proceedings has suggested that either the Barrister or the Solicitor is unaware of their obligations to the Court as officers of the Court. The second declaration will not be made.The last issue is the question of costs. Costs are not a punishment. Costs are intended to be compensation for the expense of enforcing one’s rights or defending one’s rights.In this case, there is significant agreement. The proceedings commenced with a controversy as to the law,but because of the history of theBoenschmatter, the legal controversies dissipated. It cannot be said that either party behaved unreasonably. Nevertheless, the Solicitor has sought to enforce rights and has expended money in the process.The Court has a wide discretion in relation to costs. Ordinarily, costs will follow the event. Where a matter is settled, the Court does not engage in amini trialto determine who wouldhave won or where the merits of the proceedings lie. At the same time, whenaparty capitulates on the claim, then there is good reason to award costs to follow the event, being the result of the proceedings.[8]The proper exercise of the discretion reposed in the Court requires an analysis of the facts of a particular case. The circumstances that have given rise to a plaintiff abandoning its proceedings or to a defendant capitulating in relation toorders need to be examined,and the discretion of the Court needs to reflect the compensatory principle, the overriding purpose of theCivil Procedure Actand, to the extent not otherwise covered,justice between the parties.[9]The Court, prior to 6 August 2024, was intending toamend the terms of the declarations sought and do so to take account of the issues raised by the Barrister. If those circumstances were to have prevailed,the Solicitorwould havelargely succeeded in the declaration initially sought. However, theinitialproceedings were, in the view of the Court,unnecessary.Once the Certificate of Determination had been issued, the Solicitor could have resisted any attempt to register the Certificate of Determination of Review and/or Costs Certificateon the basis ofthe law as ultimately determined. Instead, the Solicitor obtained interlocutory injunctions preventing the registration of the Costs Certificate and instituted the proceedings for declarations.It is unfortunate that the liability to pay costs and/or the amount of themhas resulted in the amount of litigation that has transpired both in these proceedings and theBoenschmatter. To some extent,at least, litigation about costsis like a dog chasing its tail - it may be never ending and rarely brings about a result with which either party is satisfied.Assuming that the Solicitor was entitled to commence the proceedings in the way that he did, by the time the matter came for hearing before the Court as presently constituted, the need for the proceedings to insist upon the declaration in the terms sought was certainly unnecessary. The Court could, were it so minded,havedividedthecosts betweenthe earlier costs and the costs of the hearing.Since 6 August 2024, as noted earlier, the Solicitor no longer seeks the first declaration. Such is a sensible and appropriate approach. I continue to hold the view that there should be no order for costs.For the foregoing reasons,the Court makes the following orders:The Court notes that, by an undertaking given through his solicitor to the Court, the defendant will not register the Certificate of Determination of Review dated 22 April 2021 in the amount of $2,100.45, relating to the costs of the Review Panel, or otherwise pursue the amount of that Certificate against theplaintiff;The Summons is otherwisedismissed;Each party shall bear their own costs.**********Endnotes1.Costs Agreement, Ex CB1, p 21-22.2.Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW), s 172(1).3.Bingham v Bevan (2023) 111 NSWLR 287; [2023] NSWCA 86 (Basten AJA, Meagher and White JJA agreeing)4.Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; ex parte Lai Qin (1997) 186 CLR 622; [1997] HCA 6 (McHugh J).5.Commonwealth v Gretton [2008] NSWCA 1176.Brooks v Burns Philp Trustee Co Ltd (1969) 121 CLR 432 at 459; cited in the State of Victoria v Sutton (1998) 195 CLR 291; [1998] HCA 56 at [38].7.Moschi v Lep Air Services Ltd [1973] AC 331 at 346-7, per Lord Diplock.8.Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; ex parte Lai Qin (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 625; [1997] HCA 6; Northern Territory v Sangare (2019) 265 CLR 164; [2019] HCA 25 at [25].9.Nadilo v Eagleton [2021] NSWCA 232; Calokerinos, Executor of the Estate of the late George Sclavos v Aantcorp Pty Ltd [2023] NSWSC 148 (Robb J).DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

He has a history of acute psychosis characterised by agitation, thought-disorder, paranoiddelusionand auditory hallucinations. He has a history of non-compliance with treatment in the community and refusal to accept oral antipsychotic medications.[11]The report refers to RL having“a high loading of historical (static) risk factors for future violence in the long term”. He also has a“moderate to high loading of dynamic risk factors”although“there has been some reduction in his clinical risk factors in the last 6 months since he was transferred to ClovellyWard (at the Forensic Hospital). When he“is acutely psychotic due to relapse of his Schizophrenia and/or substance use relapse, he poses a high risk of harm toothers”. This has abated in his current placement setting and“his current risk of violence is moderate”.[12]As to placement, the authors wrote:[13][RL] currently requires ongoing placement in a high secure environment, with the overall levels of relational, procedural, and physical security only available in the Forensic Hospital, a high secure forensic mental health unit. He requires long-term antipsychotic medication and including treatment with depot antipsychotic medication due to refusal of oral medications. He requires ongoing management around his access to female patients and interactions with female staff. He requires ongoing individual psychological support.Transfer of [RL] to a less secure hospital at his stage would reduce the likelihood of adherence with his management plan and increase the probability of an exacerbation of his mental illness with resultant potential aggression and risk to others.The doctors concluded that“the safety of the public is likely to be seriously endangered by [RL’s] release”and“there is no less restrictive placement option currently available to [RL] that is consistent with safe and effective care”.[14]The opinions and conclusions of Drs Forde and MacDonald are consistent with those in earlier reports:Report of Dr Fergus Hill and Dr Kirsty MacDonald, 25 August 2023.[15]Report of Dr Anna Farrar, 6 March 2023.[16]Report of Dr Robyn Shiels and Dr Anna Farrar, 13 September 2022.[17]The Mental Health Review Tribunal in its six-monthly review on 14 March 2024accepted the doctors’assessment.

In the“Risk Assessment”section of the report he referred to historical factors which included matters of violence in RL’s criminal history with multiple charges of assault, the most serious being the index offences.

Of particular concern is the report that RL“has continued to make repeated requests to stop his medications. He has not demonstrated a positive response to interventions aimed at improving his insight.”[22]Under the heading“Risk Formulation”, DrDayalanwrote:[23][RL] has a high loading of historical risk factors for violence. These factors are static in nature and indicate an elevated risk of violence in the long-term. [RL] has a moderate loading of clinical/dynamic risk factors in his current setting. As noted earlier, there has been a reduction in some of the dynamic risk variables over his stay at the Forensic Hospital. This can be largely attributable to thestructured environment, enforced treatment and supervision by staff with expertise in forensic mental health.There is not much evidence of any internal shifts in his thinking or attitude that would indicate the reduction in the dynamic risk factors would be sustained without adequate supervision. Therefore, any reduction in the level of monitoring and supervision would need to be graded and done in a supported environment. In his current state, there is a high likelihood of escalation of risk factors if [RL] were to be released into the community.In responding to the statutory test of whether RL posed a risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient, DrDayalanprovided an affirmative response.[24]Healso considered thatRL cannotbe adequately managed by other less restrictive means, stating,“In my opinion, placement in a secure psychiatric facility such as the Forensic Hospital would be the least restrictive form of managing his risk of harm to others”.[25]DeterminationThe foregoing is sufficient to demonstrate why it must be concluded at this preliminary stage,on the assumption the matters in the supporting documents are provedand considering the neutral position adopted by the defendant, that if RL were to no longer be a forensic patient at the expiration of his limiting term on 7 October 2024 he would likely regress, particularly in terms of substance abuse and complying with the need to take medication to address his mental health issues. That in turn would likely exacerbate to a significant extent the prospect of him committing acts of violence whether prompted by a psychotic episode or in a context of intoxication by substances. Serious harm to members of the community is a real possibility if such circumstances eventuate.In terms of the statutory test for the making of orders at the preliminary hearing stage, the documentary materialis capable of establishingthat there is a high degree of probability, that RL presents an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases to be a forensic patient and this risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means. In other words, thematters in the supporting documents would, if proved, justify the making of an extension orderOrdersThe following orders are made:Two qualified psychiatrists, registeredpsychologistsor medical practitioners (or a combination of such persons) be appointed to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by a date to be fixed.The defendant is directed to attend those examinations.The defendant is subject to an interim order for the extension of his status as a forensic patient commencing from the expiry of the limiting term on 7 October 2024 for a period of three months.**********Endnotes1.Yehia J made an order on 18 June 2024 that the defendant’s name is to be suppressed and that he is to be referred to in connection with these proceedings by the pseudonym “RL”.2.Joint statement of agreed facts [2]-[3].3.s 126(5) of the Act.4.ss 130, 131 of the Act.5.ss 126(5)), 130 of the Act.6.s 122(1) of the Act.7.Court Book pp75, 77-78.8.CB p80.9.Report of Mental Health Review Tribunal, 14 March 2024, at [13]-[14].10.Joint statement of agreed facts [11]; Bail Report CB p1.11.Report of Drs Forde and MacDonald, 30 January 2024, at p9.12.Ibid p10.13.Ibid p11.14.Ibid p12.15.CB p257.16.CB p271.17.CB p286.18.Report of Mental Health Review Tribunal, 14 March 2024, at [30](iii).19.Report of Dr Sathish Dayalan, 11 March 2024, at p8.20.Ibid p19.21.Ibid p19.22.Ibid p20.23.Ibid p21.24.Ibid p23.25.Ibid p24.DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The JWS Defendants proposed that the disclosure of the Relevant Documents in an unredacted form should be limited to these parties’legal representatives and expert witnesses.In the substantive proceedings, each of Thenford and, by its cross claim, Premier claims that the affairs of the Fifth Defendant (Skytraders) have been conducted in an oppressive manner.Thenfordholds a17.44% interestand Premier holds a 30.77% interestin the issued share capital in Skytraders. The First Defendant(Mr Mackay)is theChairmanandChiefExecutiveOfficer of Skytraders and the Second Defendant(Scarp)is trustee of the Mackay Family Trust.Mr Mackay and Scarp togetherown51.79%of the issued ordinary share capital of Skytraders. The Fourth Defendant(Hielands)is a shareholder in Skytraders. Hielands’sole director and shareholder is Mr Mackay’s son, who is an executive of Skytraders.Skytradersis engaged in the business of providing specialist air charter services, primarily to government entities.Ithas filed a submitting appearance, except as to costs.The Relevant Documents relate to the affairs of Skytraders.The JWS Defendants’application is premised on the following propositions:first,the principals of each of Thenford and Premierareclosely associated with entities which are trade rivals of Skytraders;andsecondly, each of the Relevant Documents contains sensitive commercial information of Skytraders (namely, the information proposed to be redacted) which, if it were disclosed to a trade rival,would be to the disadvantage of Skytraders and/or to the advantage ofthatrival.Thenford and Premier disputed each of those propositions and contended that, even if these propositions were established, theHarmanundertaking provided sufficient protection to Skytraders. They submitted that each of the Relevant Documents should be disclosed to them in an unredacted form.The proper framework for considering the applicationAs noted above, the JWS Defendants sought a suppression order under section 7 of theCSNPO Act. However, as the JWS Defendants acknowledged in their opening remarksat the hearing ofthis application, that was not the correct framework for considering the confidentiality issue that arises at this stage of the proceedings.Pursuant to section 7(b) of theCSNPO Act, the Court has power to make a suppression order in respect of“information that comprises evidence, or information about evidence, given in proceedings before the court”. At present, no evidence has been filed in the proceedings (other than on interlocutory applications).The Relevant Documents have been provided by the JWS Defendantsas a result ofcertain procedures requiring disclosure of documents.Three of the Relevant Documents were referred to in a defence filed by the JWS Defendants. Subsequently, the JWS Defendants were served with a Notice to Produce, seeking production of those documents.The other eight Relevant Documents were produced pursuant to section 26 of theCivil Procedure Act 2010(Vic)(CPA Vic). These proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria, and subsequently transferred to this Court. Section 26 relevantly provides that a person to whom the overarching obligations in that Act apply must disclose, to each other party:the existence of all documents that are, or have been, inthat person’spossession, custody or control–(a)of which thepersonis aware; and(b)which theperson considers, or ought reasonably consider, are critical to the resolution of the dispute.These eightRelevant Documentswere identified by the JWS Defendants as“critical to the resolution of the dispute”in these proceedings, and were accordingly disclosed.Section 27 of theCPA Vicimposes a specific statutory obligation in respect ofanydocuments disclosed pursuant to s 26, which is additional to the usualHarmanobligation. It provides as follows:(1)A person who receives any information or documents provided by another person involved in the civil proceedingas a result ofdisclosure in compliance with the overarching obligation in section 26 is subject to an obligation not to use the information or documents, or permit the information or documents to be used, for a purpose other than in connection with the civil proceeding.(2)The obligation under subsection (1) is taken to be an obligation to the court, contravention of which constitutes contempt of court.…(5)Nothing in this section limits any other undertaking to a court (implied or specific) whether at common law or otherwise, in relation to information or documents disclosed or discovered in a civil proceeding.When these eleven Relevant Documents were disclosed, an interimregime was agreed whichinvolved, in broad terms, disclosure to the legal representatives and experts of Thenford and Premier, pending the resolution of any dispute as to the confidentiality of the material.Accordingly, the issue which ariseson the present applicationis notan issue as towhether material which is in evidence should be subject to a suppression orderunder theCSNPO Act(whichwould raiseconsiderations of open justice), but insteadan issue as towhether Thenford and Premier should be able to inspect unredacted versions of theRelevant Documents, or whether, having regard to the commercial sensitivity of certain information in those documents, inspection of the unredacted versions should be, at this stage, limited to their legal representatives and experts.Ordinarily, the fact that discovered documents are confidential will not be a sufficient reason to deny inspection, as the implied undertakings that the documents will be used only for the purpose of the litigation will provide sufficient protection:BidvestAustralia Ltd v Auzcorp Pty Ltd(No 2)[2017] WASCA 23 at [41] (Martin CJ, Newnes and Murphy JJA). As noted above, there is also in this case the statutory obligation in s 27 of theCPA Vic. However, one circumstance where it has been recognised that the implied undertaking may provide insufficient protection, and where the court may impose restrictions on inspection, is where the parties are trade rivals and the documents disclosed byone party contain confidential information of use to the other party in that trade rivalry:Bidvestat [42].Each of the parties referred tothe following passage of the decision of Hayne JA(with whom Winneke P and Phillips JA agreed)inMobil Oil Australia Ltd& McDonalds Australia Ltdv Guina Developments Pty Ltd[1996] 2 VR 34 at 38, as being the leading statement of principle on this question:“While it may readily be accepted that a party is ordinarily entitled to discovery and inspection of all discoverable documents in the possession or control of the opposite party (save those for which a valid claim for privilege from production is claimed) it is important to bear steadily in mind that discovery is but a tool to be used in the pursuit of justice and that the right to discovery and inspection is not without its limits. The first and most obvious limit is that a party does not have a right to inspect documents that are discovered if there is a valid claim to privilege from production (as eg on the grounds of legal professional privilege). Secondly, because the law recognises that the assertion of compulsive power requiring production must be balanced against the needs of justice, a party inspecting the documents of the opposite party may not use them except for the purposes of the action in which discovery is made.Where it is said that the documents are confidential, it may be accepted that the fact that the documents are confidential will not ordinarily be a sufficient reason to deny inspection by the opposite party. In most cases, the fact that the documents may not be used except for the purposes of the litigation concerned will be sufficient protection to the party producing them. But where, as here, the party obtaining discovery is a trade rival of the person whose secrets it is proposed should be revealed by discovery and inspection, other considerations arise.Once the documents are inspected by the principals of the trade rival the information which is revealed is known to the trade rival and cannot be forgotten. Confidentiality is destroyed once and for all (at least so far as theparticular traderival is concerned). To say that the trade rival is bound not to use the documents except for the purposes of the action concerned is, in a case such as this, to impose upon that trade rival an obligation that is impossible of performance by him and impossible of enforcement by the party whose secrets have been revealed. How is the trade rival to forget what internal rate of return the competitor seeks to achieve on a new investment of the kind in question? How is the party whose hurdle rate has been revealed to know whether the rival has used the information in framing a tender? Thus, if the trade rival may inspect the documents concerned, the confidentiality of the information in them is at once destroyed. Is that necessary for the attainment of justice in theparticular case?”In relying on this statement of principle, the JWS Defendants accepted that it was a necessary predicate for their application to limitinspection of the Relevant Documentsthat each of Thenford and Premier was a trade rival of Skytraders and that, if this was not established, the application would fail.Further, the JWS Defendants accepted thatit was alsonecessaryfor themto identify,with specificity,the information in theRelevant Documentswhich is said to be commercially sensitive and to establish that it does in fact have current commercial sensitivity.In that regard, I was provided with unredacted copies of theRelevant Documents, with the materialwhich wassaid to be commercially sensitiveidentified by highlighting,in order that the parties were able to makesubmissions onthe commercial sensitivity of that material.Finally, the JWS Defendants acknowledged that, even if they established thatThenford and Premierare, or are closely associated with,trade rivalsof Skytradersandthatthe material in issue is commercially sensitive,a balancing exercise must be undertaken. It is necessary to have regard not only to the risks to Skytraders if the information in question is disclosed to Thenford or Premier, but also the impact that any non-disclosure of that information will have on theability of Thenford and Premier to give instructions in relation to the proceedingsand thereby to prosecute their claims against the JWS Defendants.In that regard, it is significant that each of Thenford and Premier is a company associated essentially with a single individual.Mr John Sharp is the sole director and shareholder of Thenford. Mr Terrence Vickers is the sole shareholder and director of Premier.It follows that Thenford and Premier are not organisations of the type whichmight be ableto quarantinethe personsgiving instructionson behalf of the companyfrom those making operational decisions. Mr Sharp is the only person able to give instructions on behalf of Thenford,and Mr Vickers is the only person able to give instructions on behalf ofPremier.In that context, the following observations of Ball J inICAP AustraliaPtyLtd v Moebes[2010] NSWSC 738 at [11] are particularly important:“Each case will depend on its own facts. However, in my opinion, it will rarely be the case that a regime that limits access to external solicitors and counsel will meet the requirement of reasonableness. That is because those solicitors and counsel must act on the instructions of someone; and normally the person or persons giving those instructions should be entitled to see all the documents available to their advisors so that they can understand the basis of any advice given to them.”This statement of principle has often been cited in subsequent decisions: see, for example,Lenark Pty Ltd v TheChairmen 1 Pty Ltd (No 2)[2012] NSWSC 415 at [14] (per Black J),Unilever Australia Ltd v Revlon Australia Pty Ltd (No 3)[2014] FCA 1005 at [19] (per Gleeson J)andSkyscanner Ltd v Hotels Combined Pty Ltd (No 2)[2016] NSWSC 326 at [7] (per Slattery J).Finally, the JWS Defendants accepted that, if an orderwere to be maderestrictinginspectionof the unredacted versions of the Relevant Documentsto legal representatives and experts of Thenford and/or Premier, such an order would only remain in place“until further order”.In making this submission, the JWS Defendants acknowledged that, whilethey might succeed in establishingat this stageof the proceedingsthat the balance is in favour of making such arestriction oninspection, itmay benecessary, at a later stage of the proceedings,forany suchrestriction to be removedor modified(for example, for the purpose of seeking instructions on a certain matter, or for the purpose of putting on evidence).Is Mr Sharp associated with a trade rival of Skytraders?The JWS Defendantsdidnot assert thatThenfordis a trade rival of Skytraders.Instead, the JWSDefendantsreliedon the fact that the sole director and shareholder of Thenford, Mr Sharp, is also theNon-ExecutiveChairman ofRegional Express Holdings Ltd (administrators appointed) (Rex), and submittedthat Rex is a trade rival of Skytraders. In particular,the JWS Defendants submitted that Rexhas engaged,or is engaging,in competition with Skytraders in respect of contracts to provide air charter services togovernment bodies including theAustralian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the Australian Border Force (ABF);in respect ofthe provision of“fly in, fly out”(FIFO) services; andin respect ofthe provision of aeromedical services.Thenford disputedthat Rex is a competitor of Skytraders in respect of any of those types of services;submittedthat the businesses of the two entities are very different;andpointed outthat, in any event, Rex has been in administration since 30 July 2024 and Mr Sharp’s powers as a director have been, and remain, suspended.Mr Sharp was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of Rex on 5 June 2024, afterhaving previously servedas itsViceChairman for a period of 20 years.Rex is the holding company of a group of companies providing various servicesin the aviation industry. The media release of 5 June 2024, which announced Mr Sharp’s appointment as Chairman, stated as follows:“Rex is Australia’s largest independent regional and domestic airline operating a fleet of Boeing 737-800NG aircraft to 56 destinations throughout all states in Australia. In addition to the airline Rex, the Rex Group comprises wholly owned subsidiaries Pel-Air Aviation (air freight, aeromedical and charter operator), theAustralian Airline Pilot Academy with campuses in Wagga Wagga and Ballarat, and propeller maintenance organisation, Australian Aerospace Propeller Maintenance. Rex is also a 50 per cent shareholder of National Jet Express (NJE), a premier Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO), charter and freight operator.”Until 4 April 2024, Mr Sharp wasalso theChairman of Pel Air Aviation Pty Ltd (Pel Air).The evidence establishes the following matters.AAD–Skytraders hadacontract with the AAD to provide aviation services. This contract expired on 30 June 2024. Skytraders is competing in a tender for a new contract with the AAD. In July and August 2023, Rex issueda number ofmedia releases in which it statedthat it intendedto obtain the contract to provide services to the AAD. For example, on 11 July 2023, Rex issued a media release, headed“Rex intends to be aerial operator for Australian Antarctic Division”. This media release referred to Rex having submitted a response to the Request for Information issued by the AAD in a bid to secure this work. However, Rex did not ultimately tender for that work prior to going into administration.ABF–Skytraders had a contract with the ABF to provideair transportservices, which expired on 17 December 2023.This was Skytraders’largest contract, constituting approximately 60% of its total revenue in the 2023 financial year. On 4 September 2023, the ABF released a restricted request for quote (RFQ).Skytraders issueda proposal on 3 October 2023 in response tothe RFQ.The successful parties in that procurement process obtained contracts that are due to expire in December 2024. Skytraders intends to bid for any replacement contractto provide air transport services to the ABF.On 29 February 2024, Rex published a presentation on its half-year financial results in which it stated that it had“submitted a response to the Request for Expression of Interest (REOI) issued by the Department of Home Affairs for the Provision of Aerial Surveillance Services for the [ABF]”.FIFO–Skytraders provides FIFO services. For example, it has a current contract(entered in January 2024)to provide twice-weekly return flights for Mineral Resources Ltd between Brisbane Airport and two mine sites in Western Australia.It has also provided FIFO services for other mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue,in the past year.In an article published in theAustralianFinancialReviewon 15 July 2022, Mr Sharp was quoted as saying:“Rex has continued to advance and move into the domestic market space and now into this fly in, fly out business”. On 30 September 2022, Rex purchased National Jet Express, which primarily carries out FIFO activities.In the media release announcing this acquisition, Rex stated that“it had bold plans to grow and transform its latest acquisition into Australia’s premier Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) operator”.Rexproposed to do so by overlaying its“financial and operational prowess on NJE’s core strengths”.The JWS Defendants allege in theirDefence that from around May 2022, Mr Sharp made comments to the directors and employees of Skytraders to the effect that he intended to facilitate Rex Group and Pel-Air competing successfully against Skytradersin ordertosecure business away from Skytraders in the future.Aeromedical services–During 2022, Skytraders and Rex’s subsidiary, Pel-Air, competed fora number ofaeromedical contracts, which were ultimately awarded to Pel-Air. Rex issued media releases announcing that these contracts had been awarded to Pel-Air, which described Pel-Air as part of the Rex Group. Mr Sharp was quoted in these media releases (as Pel-Air Chairman).I am satisfied that these materials show that Rex and the Rex Group (of which Rex is the holding company) have competed in the recent past with Skytraders for various contractsfor services.AlthoughRexultimatelydecidednot tosubmit a tender for the AAD or the ABF contracts,the evidence referred to above establishesthat Rexhas had,in the past year, an interest in competing with Skytraders for substantial contracts to provide aerial services to government departments or agencies. Further, the Rex Group has been, through Pel-Airand NJE, competing with Skytraders for other contracts for FIFO and aeromedical services.Thenford pointed to evidence that the businesses of Rex and Skytraders are different in various respects. For example, Rex has a far greater number of aircraft and employees, and far higher revenue, and carries on a regional public transport business (while Skytraders does not). However, as the JWS Defendants submitted, the difference in scale is not decisive. For example, while Qantas is much larger than Rex and offers services which Rex does not (such as international flights), Qantas is in competition with Rexfor certain services.Thenford also relied on the following matters:in July 2024, Rex decided that it no longer wanted to pursue specialist government aviation service contracts (including the AAD and ABF contracts), andinstead decidedto focus on its core business;on30 July 2024, the boardof Rex appointed voluntary administrators and, as a result, the powers of the directors (including Mr Sharp)have beensuspended and the Administrators have control of the company’s business,propertyand affairs under section 437A of theCorporations Act 2001(Cth); andprior to the appointment of Administrators, a shareholder of Rex had requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of the members of Rex seeking resolutions to replace the board of Rex, including Mr Sharp, and orders have been madeby the Federal Courtdeferring that meeting to a date that is 20 business days after the date of the second meeting of creditors of Rex.Those matters give rise to a significant degree of uncertaintyregardingRex’s future operations and management. For example (and without expressing any view, or having any basis to express any view, on the likelihood of any suchoutcomes), it may be that Rex exits administration and subsequently provides services of a different scope to those provided prior to administration, which may or may not include the pursuit of specialist government aviation service contracts, or the provision of FIFO or aeromedical services; and it may be that Mr Sharp is removed as a director of Rex.However, this application must be considered on the basis that Mr Sharp currently is a director of Rex, that Rex is the holding company of a group which does provide aeromedical and FIFO services, and that Rex has in the recent past expressed interest in acquiring specialist government aviation service contracts. Those matters are sufficient, in my view, to establish that Mr Sharp is associated with a trade rival.Needless to say, ifthe position changes, and Mr Sharp ceases to have an association with Rex, or the Rex Group ceases to provide services of the type also provided by Skytraders, thenthe question whether there is any basis for a restriction on Mr Sharp’s access to documents would need to be revisited.Is Premier / Mr Vickers associated with a trade rival of Skytraders?The JWS Defendants do not assert that Premier is a trade rival of Skytraders.Instead, the JWS Defendants rely on the fact that Mr Vickers, who is the sole director and shareholder of Premier, carries on a business as a consultant to the airline industry. In particular, the JWS Defendants relied on the following statement on Mr Vickers’LinkedIn profile:\"As an aviation business consultant at Premier International, I work with clients on a range of projects, such as feasibility studies, business plans, market analysis, risk management, contract negotiations, and regulatory compliance. I also share my expertise and insights on flights, aircraft, and aviation trends and best practices through publications, presentations, and workshops. I have successfully delivered multiple projects for companies through my involvement in Australia and internationally, such as Skytraders, Kestrel Aviation, and Flight Simulators International. I use my skills in aircraft, flights, and aviation to provide high-quality and tailored solutions for each client and company we are directly involved in.”Mr Vickersacceptedthat this is an accurate statement of his working endeavours.In addition toreferring toPremier and Skytraders, the statement quoted above refers to two other companies with which Mr Vickers has been involved. The first isKestrelAviation Pty Ltd. This company was established in around 1986, with Mr Vickers as a shareholder and director. It provides specialist helicopter aviation services. Kestrel is not a competitor of Skytraders, and Mr Vickers does not, in any case, have any continuing involvement with, and does not provide consultancy services to, Kestrel. The second isFlight SimulatorsInternational Pty Ltd. Mr Vickers founded this companyinaround 1996, for the purpose of purchasing and operating aBoeing727 simulator on behalf of three freighter operators, to support the training needs of these companies. The simulator wasretiredfrom service in 2014, and Flight Simulators ceased to operate at that time and has now been deregistered. In any case, Skytraders has never been involved in operating flight simulators as a commercial venture.There was also evidence that in August 2023, Mr Vickers became a director of and shareholder in Aviation Survey Group Pty Ltd, which focuses on the provision of highly modified aircraft to service the aerial survey industry using high-performance LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and Optical sensors. This company is not engaged in the business of providing specialist air charter services, and Skytraders is not in the business of providing modified aircraft to the aerial survey industry.Ultimately, the JWS Defendants relied on the proposition that Mr Vickers was, through his LinkedIn profile, offering to provide consultancy services to entities in the aviation industry on a range of projects,including“business plans”,“market analysis”and“contract negotiations”,and therefore might have been retained, or might be retained, to provide such services to a trade rival of Skytraders.There was no evidence that Mr Vickers has ever provided consultancy services to atrade rivalof Skytraders; or is currently providing such services to atrade rivalof Skytraders; or has taken any steps (other thanby publishing the above statementonhisLinkedIn page) to seek to provide such services to atrade rivalof Skytraders.Premier referred to the observations of Elliott J inCargill Australia Ltd v Viterra Malt Pty Ltd (No 17)[2018] VSC 750 at [163]-[164]. His Honour there said that the term“trade rivalry”was“very general”, and continued as follows:“It may refer to‘fierce trade rivals’or rivals who compete in a far less combative manner. It encompasses many possibilities. The term might apply to the whole of a rival’s business or only a very small part of it. Further, it may involve direct, immediate competition with respect to a specific business opportunity or the respective businesses of the rivals more generally to, at the other end of the spectrum, only the real possibility of competition in the future.”Having regard to the matters outlined above,there is, on the evidence, no more than a potential for Mr Vickers, at some time which is unknown, to provide consultancy services of a scope which is unknown, to a business whose identity is unknown, which competes with Skytraders in respects which are unknown.I do not consider that, in these circumstances, the risk of sensitive commercial information coming into the hands of a trade rival is sufficientso astojustify preventing Premier(and through Premier, Mr Vickers)from inspecting the information in the Relevant Documents which is said to be commercially sensitive. That is particularly so in circumstances where Premier is subject to theHarmanundertaking in respect ofall ofthe Relevant Documents andwhere Premierisalsosubject to the statutory obligation under s 27 of theCPA Vicin respect of the eight documents which have been disclosed pursuant to s 26 of that Act. In addition, Mr Vickershasindicated that, to the extent that any of the information in the Relevant Documents is found to be commercially sensitive, he is prepared to give an undertaking not to disclose this information to any third party.Having regard to the matters outlined above, Premier should be given access to the unredactedRelevant Documents,that access beingconditionalon Mr Vickerspersonallyproviding an undertaking that he will not disclose any of the information which I have determined to be commercially sensitive to any third party.I turn now to deal withthe commercial sensitivity of the information in the Relevant Documents.Is the redacted information commercially sensitive?For the purposes of considering the commercial sensitivity of the material in the Relevant Documents which the JWS Defendants seek to redact, I inspected unredacted copies of those documents,in whichthe proposed redactionswerehighlighted.Each of the parties provided written and oral submissions on the individual documentsand the highlighted text. Without disclosing the content of any of the information said to be commercial sensitive, my conclusions in respect ofthe relevant information ineach of the 11Relevant Documentsare set out below.In reaching these views,I have considered, and balanced, both the sensitivity of the information and the extent to which it is necessary, as matters currently stand,to have access to the informationin order toprovide instructionsregarding the conduct ofthese proceedings.Document 1 –General Ledgerentries: Leasehold Improvement CostsThe first document is an entry from Skytraders’General Ledger showing Leasehold ImprovementCosts. This document was disclosed pursuant to s 26 of the CPA Vic because it is relevant to allegations concerning office renovation costs. The JWS Defendants proposed to redact three line items on the basis that those items are irrelevant to theallegations concerningoffice renovation costs, and instead reveal the price paid by Skytraders for modifications made to an aircraft which it still leases and uses for charter work.It was said that these prices were the subject of significant negotiation and disclosure of them would give rivals a competitive advantage by allowing them“not just to negotiate with suppliers for price matching but to be able to more accurately estimate the nature and cost of these alteration works when competing against Skytraders for tender submission purposes”.I am not satisfied that this information has ongoing commercial sensitivity. The three entries all bear dates in 2019. It is not apparent why the revelation to a trade rival of prices paid for modifications to an aircraft(the nature of which is not specified in those line items), somefiveyears ago, would place that rival at an advantage or place Skytraders at a disadvantage. Further, I accept the submission that it may be necessary to seek instructionsas to whether, and inwhat way, these line items bear any relationship to the ledger entry in which they appear.For those reasons, I conclude that the balance is in favour of this documentbeing providedto Thenford and Premierfor inspectionin an unredacted form.Documents 2 and 6 –General LedgerEntries: Administrative ExpensesDocuments 2 and 6 can be considered together, as they are similar documents for consecutive financial years (ending, respectively,30 June 2022 and 30 June 2023). These documents areentries from Skytraders’General Ledgerin respect of administrative expenses. These documents together comprise around 140 pages. The only material said to be commercially sensitive is a handful of line items in each document. Those line items relate to unrealised currency gains on aircraft leases. They were said to be commercially sensitive toSkytraders“because they may allow a competitor to calculate the leasing costs incurred by Skytraders in relation to specific aircraft”(which were identified in those line items). There was evidence before the Court that aircraft leasing costs are one of the largest, if not the largest, cost element in Skytraders’aircraft services contracts;thatlease rates vary significantly in the industry;thatSkytraders has had a number of aircraftfor a long time, with monthly lease costs well below new contact rates, which provides it with a competitive advantage; andthatif competitors areaware of costs paid by other airlines, they could use that information in their own leasing negotiations.On the basis of this evidence, I am satisfied that the information proposed to be redacted has commercialsensitivity, andcould advantage a trade rival (noting that there was evidence that Rex leases aircraft).Further, I do not consider that the redaction of the specific line items identified by the JWS Defendants will hamper the abilityof Thenford’s legal representativesto obtain instructions, since the JWS Defendants do not propose to redact the“totals”shown in respect of unrealised currency gains in each of the two documents, but only the breakdown of the individual amounts in respect of specific leases which are included in that total.The JWS Defendants have established a basis for providingDocuments 2 and 6 to Thenfordfor inspectionin a form which has this information redacted. The documents should be provided to Vickers in an unredacted form,provided thatMr Vickerspersonallygives a confidentialityundertaking in respect of the relevant information (that is, the specific line items).Documents 3 and 4 – Directors’ resolution and emailDocuments 3 and 4 can be consideredtogether, sincethey raise a similar issue. Document 3 is asole director’s resolution, signed by Mr Mackay and dated 19 September 2022. Document 4 is an email from the Director of Finance at Skytraders dated21September 2022. Skytraders proposed redacting a limited amount of the text ofeach documenton the basis that the redacted material contained“commercially sensitive information regarding the manner in which Skytraders remunerates its senior employees, which may assist a competitor to poach a member of the Executive Team”.I have reviewed the material. I am not satisfied, having regard to the fact that it is some two years oldand having regard tothe general terms in which it is expressed, that the information has such commercial sensitivity as to warrant restricting the ability of the other parties to inspect this material. Further, the documents are relevant to akeyissuein dispute in the proceedings,regarding the promotion and remuneration of Mr Mackay’s children.In those circumstances, and having regard to theprotection already afforded to the JWS Defendants and Skytraders by theHarmanobligation and the statutory obligation under s 27 of theCPA Vic, I consider that the documents should be provided to each of Thenford and Premierfor inspectionin an unredacted form.Documents 5 and 7 – Memoranda prepared by Titan PartnersDocuments 5 and 7 can be considered together, since they are similar documents, prepared in consecutive years. Document 5 is a memorandum prepared by Titan Partners to the directors of Skytraders dated 26 October 2022. The memorandum states that it was prepared in response to a requestto perform financial analysis on the performance of Skytraders to determine a reasonable dividend that the Company can declare.Document 7 is a similar memorandum prepared by Titan dated 1 November 2023.These documents are relevant to a central issue in theoppressionproceedings, namely, Skytraders’decision notto pay a dividend in each of thefinancialyears ending 30 June 2022(FY2022)and 30 June 2023(FY2023).There were several specific categories of information whichthe JWS Defendantsproposed to redact.First,theyproposed to redacta number ofstatements in each memorandum which disclose the terms of contracts which have been negotiated between Skytraders and its key government clients, including the AAD.In the event thatI determined the“trade rival”issue adversely to Thenford (as I have done), Thenford did not oppose the redaction of this material.Secondly,the JWS Defendants sought to redact information which was said to be in the nature of“key metrics such as flying hours performed by Skytraders under each of those contracts [with its key government contracts]”. I have reviewed the material. I am not satisfied that information regarding variations in flying hours byparticular aircraft, in periods going back to the first quarter of FY2022 (that is, July to September 2021) is of such ongoing commercial sensitivity that it should be withheld from Thenford. There should be no redaction of this material.Thirdly, the JWS Defendants sought to redact financial information relating torevenue and expenses in respect of variouscontracts(which include the ABF and AAD contracts). The JWS Defendantspointed outthat they did not seek to redact any of the financial analysisof Skytraders’performance overall, but only the financial analysis in respect ofthe performance ofindividual contracts,on the basisthat“a number of [these contracts] are still ongoing”.The difficulty with evidence in this form is that it obscures which contracts are still ongoing. It appears to be implicit thata number ofthe contracts are not ongoing. It is not apparent why there would be any current commercial sensitivity in, for example, the revenue and costs inFY2022 in respect of a contract which ended two or more years ago.In addition, for contracts which remain on foot, it is not apparent whycertain individual line itemsregarding costs onparticular contractsin FY2022 (such as fuel costs in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 in respect of a contract which may, or may not, remain on foot)areofongoingcommercial sensitivity.Finally, there is some forecast informationin the memoranda, but this forecast information regarding contracts appearsmainlyto relate to periods which are now completed. For example, the Titan Partners’memorandum of October 2022 contains a“variable cost forecast for FY2023 based on flight activity”in respect ofparticular contracts. It is difficult to see the commercial sensitivity of a forecast for FY2023, which may or may not have been realised, in respect of a contract which may or may not remain on foot.The information in such a forecast would not appear to have any ongoing currency.In the evidence led by the JWS Defendants regardingthe sensitivity of the information redacted in these memoranda, the only contractswhichare specifically namedas havingparticular sensitivityarethe AAD contractand the ABF contract. The JWS Defendants’solicitor deposed as follows:[In relation to the October 2022 memorandum]“One of the major contracts considered in the memorandum is Skytraders’ contract with the AAD, which I am instructed is currently up for tender. As set out in detail at paragraph X above, Rex Group has expressly stated its intention to compete for this contract.”[In relation to the November 2023 memorandumof affidavit of Easton of 7 August]“As with the FY22 TP Memorandum, I am instructed and believe that the FY23 TP Memorandum again contains a significant amount of information in relation to Skytraders'servicing of the AAD contract, such as the costs incurred by Skytraders in servicing that contract, flying hours performed and terms agreed. Rex Group has recently expressed its intention to compete with Skytraders forthe upcoming AAD tender (as referred to in paragraph ## above), and access to this information is likely to provide it with a commercial advantage in that process.”In addition, in a passage treated as submission, the JWS Defendants’solicitor stated in a reply affidavit that the two memoranda contain financial analysis“for major contracts that Skytraders currently holds (or held until recently) that may be the subject of an RFT in the near future, such as the AAD Contract and ABF Contract”.The JWS Defendants did not identify anyparticular contractswhich are the subject of individual analysis in the two memoranda (other than the AAD Contract and the ABF Contract) which were said to have ongoing commercial sensitivity.I am mindful thatthese two memoranda are documentswhichhavebeen identified by the JWS Defendants asof critical relevance to one of the key issues in the oppression proceedings brought by Thenford and Premier. I accept that the legal representatives of Premier and Thenford will need instructions in respect of the information in these two memorandain order totest the appropriateness of Skytraders’refusal to pay a dividend in respect of each of FY2022 and FY2023. Mr Sharp and Mr Vickers are well placed to provide those instructions having regard to theirknowledgeof and experience in the airline industry, and their long association and familiarity with Skytraders’business. For example, Thenford’s solicitor gave evidence that:“The dividend analyses prepared by Titan Partners include various assumptions, forecasts and industry predictions about which I believe it will be necessary to obtain instructions from Mr Sharp as he has formerly been a director and consultant to Skytraders and can understand and assess the reasonableness of those forecasts, predictions or analyses”.I am satisfied that there is sufficient commercial sensitivity in three categories of information to justify a restriction on the inspection of that material, namely:any text which discloses the terms of contractswhich have been negotiated between Skytraders and its key government clients (including the AAD);anyinformation which records, or which could be used to calculate, the financial performance in respect of the AAD and ABF contracts; and(consistently with the conclusion I have reached in relation toDocuments 2 and 6)any information that discloses lease costs.Otherwise, I consider that the balance of the documents should be provided to Thenfordfor inspectionin an unredacted form, and the whole of the documents should be provided to Premier in an unredacted form (provided thatMr Vickers personally gives a confidentialityundertaking in respect of the material that is redacted in the Thenford version).Document 8–Minutes of BoardMeeting of 1 November 2023Document 8 (which is the last of the documents disclosed under s 26 of theCPA Vic) is the minutes of a meeting of the directors of Skytraders held on 1 November 2023.Skytraders seeks to redact only one line of this document, which discloses the lease costs for two aircraft. I do not consider that this will hamper the ability of Thenford to provide instructions in relation to this document.Consistently with the view I have reached in relation toDocuments 2 and 6, the JWS Defendants would be justified in redacting that information in the version provided to Thenfordfor inspection. The document should be provided to Premier in an unredacted form (provided thatMr Vickers personally gives a confidentialityundertaking in respect of the material that is redacted in the Thenford version).Documents 9 to 11 – Notice to ProduceDocuments 9 to 11 were not disclosed pursuant to s 26 of theCPA Vic, but in response to a Notice to Produce in these proceedings.Document 9 is Skytraders’contract with the AAD. Document 10 is Skytraders’contract with the ABF. Document 11 is Skytraders’proposal dated 3 October 2023 in response to the RFQ issued by the ABF for air charter services.The JWS Defendants did not propose redactions in respect ofspecific information inthesethreedocuments. Rather, they submitted that thenone of these documentsshould be disclosed to Thenford and Premierfor inspection,and instead each should only be disclosed for inspectionto theirrespectivelegal representatives and experts.In the event thatI determined the“trade rival”issue adversely to Thenford (as I have done), Thenford did not oppose this course, and did not submit that this would hamper Thenford’s ability to give instructions at this stageof the proceedings.I am satisfied that these three documents have sufficient commercial sensitivity that, so far as Thenford is concerned, their inspection should be limited in the manner proposed by the JWS Defendants.So far as Premier is concerned, each ofDocuments9-11should be providedfor inspection,provided thatMr Vickerspersonally gives a confidentialityundertaking in respect of those documents.CONCLUSION andORDERSThe JWS Defendants substantially failed in their application so far as Premier is concerned. I have accepted the submission that there should be no restriction on Premier’sability to inspectto the Relevant Documents,provided thatMr Vickers personally providesa confidentialityundertaking in respect of the material that I have found to be commercially sensitive (which Mr Vickers hadoffered to do prior to the hearing). Accordingly, the JWS Defendants should pay Mr Vickers’costs of their application.As between the JWS Defendants and Thenford, there has been mixed success. I have accepted the JWS Defendants’submission that there is a basis for restricting theabilityof Thenford toinspectcommercially sensitive informationin the Relevant Documents, but I have found that the extent of the commercially sensitive information was narrower than that for which the JWS Defendantscontended. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that there be no order as to the costs of the application as between the JWS Defendants and Thenford.The parties should bring in short minutes of order to give effect to these reasons for judgment, including costs. Those orders should make clear that the regime in respect of inspection of these documents is one that lasts until further order, with liberty to apply. As I have already noted, if circumstances change so far as the issue of trade rivalry is concerned, or if the continuation of the regime is affecting Thenford’s ability properly to conduct these proceedings, then the regime will be able to be revisited.Accordingly, I make the following orders. The Court:Directs the parties to provide to the Associate to Nixon J, by 4pmon23August 2024, short minutes of order to give effect to these reasons for judgment.Directs that, if the parties are unable to agree on orders to give effect to these reasons for judgment, the parties are to notify the Associate to Nixon J, by 4pmon 23August 2024, and are to provide, at that time, the competing forms of orders.**********Amendments20 August 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tUpdated case nameDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

They are her only two children.The deceased’s husband,Herman,predeceased her in November 2020.The second defendant, Mr Emanuel,is an independent solicitorwho has consented toact as an independent administrator.Hehasfiled asubmittingappearance.The proceedings were commenced byastatement of claim filed on 6 November 2023.The first defendant filed a cross-claim on 14 June 2024,in which the plaintiff is named as the sole cross-defendant.Inlight of the fact thatthe first defendant/cross-claimant is the only active defendantin the proceedings,I will(for convenienceand unless otherwise indicated)refer to her as the defendant. I will similarly for convenience refer to the plaintiff/cross-defendant simply as the plaintiff.Probate of theWillincommon form was granted to the defendant(thesubstitute executrix)on 20February2023.Real issuesIn essence,the plaintiff alleges that the defendant(as executrix)impermissibly used the main asset of the deceased’sestate, a property at Tennyson(theTennysonproperty),as security to borrow funds in her personal capacity to pay the plaintiff monies referable to the terms of cl 8.1 of theWill. The plaintiff claims thatshedid so in breach of alleged fiduciary duties,namely,that thedefendanthas failed:(a)to actimpartially(andhasfavoured her own interests);(b)to actin the best interests of the beneficiaries;and(c) to administer the estate in accordance with the terms of theWill.Inaddition,the plaintiff contends that the defendant did not inform him that she intended to use an asset of the estate as security for any loan,andthat she has failed to account to the estate, repay the loan and discharge thesecurity(a mortgage).The plaintiffclaimsthattheconsequenceof thealleged breachesisthat the defendant is not fit to administer the estate,the grant of probate should be revoked and letters of administration withtheWillannexedshouldbegrantedto Mr Emanuel as an independent administrator.I will set out below thespecificrelief soughtin the statement of claim.However,almostall ofthe detailed relief claimed is directedtowardsand aimed to facilitatetherevocation of the grant of probate,as well asto preclude the defendantfromholding herself outas entitled to act asthelegal personal representative of the deceased.Whilst the plaintiff claimsthatbreaches of fiduciary duty by the defendant have occurred, there is no specific claim for relief that the defendant is liable to account to the estate for any loss,or for equitable compensation.The relief sought is as follows:Order that the grant ofprobate to thedefendantmade on 20 February 2023 inrespect of the estate ofthe deceasedbe revoked.Order that letters of administration,with the Willof the deceaseddated 24 April 2019annexed, be granted toMr Emanuelor,further or alternatively,tosuchother person or persons as the Court deemsappropriate.Order that the matter be remitted to the Senior Deputy Registrar in Probate tocomplete the grant.Order that any requirement for anadministrationbond be dispensed with.Order that thedefendantdeliver up, or cause to be delivered up,the originalgrant ofprobate to the Probate Registry, marked to the attention of the SeniorDeputy Registrar in Probate, within 7 days of the service of a copy of these ordersand notations upon her.Order that, in the event that the original revoked grant is not produced to the Courtby thedefendant, in accordance with these orders and notations, the SeniorDeputy Registrar in Probate proceed to completion of the grant of letters ofadministration with the Will annexed toMr Emanuel,or tosuch other person orpersons as the Court deemsappropriate, notwithstanding non-compliance with theorder(5) above.Order that thedefendantis under a continuing obligation to deliver up therevoked grant to the Court.Order, subject to further order, that thedefendant, by herself, her servants,and agents, be restrainedfrom:using, or dealing with, the grant ofprobate made on 20 February 2023, otherthan by delivery up of the grant to theCourt;acting, or purporting to act, as a legal personal representative of the deceased; andholding herself out as entitled to act as a legal personal representative of thedeceased.Order that thedefendantpersonally pay theplaintiff’sandMr Emanuel’scosts of these proceedings and theadministration of the estate,calculated on an indemnity basis,out of thedefendant’sshare of the estate and/orresiduary estate.Such further and other orders as the Court thinks fit.On the cross-claim,the defendant seeksadeclaration as to the proper construction of theWill.Specifically,thesubstantiverelief claimed is as follows:A declaration that, on the proper construction of the will of the late Elaine FayBoyd(the“Deceased”) made on 24 April 2019, the defendant was permitted tomortgage the real property located at and known as[XX]Murrays Road, Tennyson in the State of New South Wales(having certificate of title folioidentifier[X]/[XXXXXX])(the“Property”) for the purpose of raising funds to pay theplaintiff one-third of the market value of the Property as at the date of death ofthe Deceased in accordance with clause 8.1 of the Deceased’s will.On6 December 2023,the defendantfileda defence to the statement of claim. On 27 June 2024,theplaintiff fileda defence tothecross-claim.EstateAccording to theinventory ofproperty attached to the grant of probate,as at the date of her death,the deceasedownedthe Tennyson property,valued at $1.75million,and hadfundsin threebank accounts withtheNational Australia Bank(NAB)totalling $231,900.It will be noted below that the valueof the Tennyson propertystatedin the inventory of property is $25,000 more than the value given in the valuation report obtained by the defendant on 30 November 2022.Appearances and evidenceOn the hearing,Ms Glover of counsel appeared for the plaintiff and Mr Price of counsel appeared for the defendant. Mr Emanuel appeared briefly but soughtto be excused incircumstanceswherehe had filedthe submittingappearance.However,heindicatedthathemay wish to be heard on the question of costs. Subject to that qualification,neither Ms Glover nor MrPrice had any difficulty withMrEmanuel being excused, which I permitted.Both Ms Glover and Mr Priceprovided written outlines of submissions prior to thehearing, which I will cite as thePOSandDOSrespectively.The issues to be determinedaregleaned from the submissions of the respectivecounsel. The principal issuesare as follows:What is the proper construction of cl 8.1 of theWill?Ontheproperconstruction of theWill,was the defendant’s use of the Tennyson property as security to borrow the fundspermitted?Shouldthe grant of probate to the defendant be revoked and letters of administrationwiththeWillannexedbegranted to Mr Emanuel?On the hearing,the plaintiff relied upon the affidavits of:Mr Emanuel,swornon9 November 2023,givingan undertaking toadminister the estate in accordance with the terms of the Willif appointed asadministrator;Maddison Sharni Creamer, both swornon10 November 2023, the first of which witnessed the consent by the plaintiff to letters of administration being granted to Mr Emanuel and dispensing with the administration bond, and the second of which was in chief;andthe plaintiff,affirmedon3 May 2024,in reply to the defendant’s affidavit.The defendant relied upon the affidavits of:herself,swornon15 April 2024,in chief; andDonald John Shaddick,swornon10 July 2024,annexingavaluationof the Tennyson propertyand correspondencewith the plaintiff’s solicitors.Much of the affidavit material was admitted without objection,althoughthere were a few objectionsuponwhich I ruled.Counselalsotendereda number ofdocuments,including certain documentsproduced upon the call by Ms Glover of a notice to produce issued by the plaintiff to the defendantdated 19 July 2024.Family relationshipsThefollowing detailsof the family relationships,whichneithercounseldisputed,emerge from the evidence and inferences from it. Neither counselsuggested that precision was essential in respect of the following dates and ages.The deceased was born in or about 1952(derived from the uncontested fact that the deceased was 68 years oldatthe time of Herman’s death).Hermanwasaged79atthe date of his death and accordingly was born in or about 1941. He was married twice. The first marriage was to JillSackwellin or about 1967 in Texas,USA. There is one child of that marriage,a daughter,Bonny,whowas born in or about 1968.At some stageafew years after,the marriage ended seemingly by divorce.In or about 1972,Herman married the deceased. The plaintiff was born in or about 1974 and is currently approximately 49 to 50 years old. The defendant was born approximately 13 years after the plaintiff, namely in or about 1987,and is currently approximately 36 to 37 yearsold.The defendant is married to ChristopherPeeters.The Tennyson propertyTheTennysonproperty was purchased by thedeceased and Hermanin 1996. Thecouplelivedat the propertyuntil their respective deaths in 2020 and 2022.At the time ofitspurchase,the defendant wasapproximately9yearsoldand the plaintiffwasapproximately 22yearsold.The property comprises 10,000m².There are two dwellings on the property,consisting ofa primary dwelling and a secondary dwelling.The primary dwelling is a freestanding brick veneer and tile roof residential dwelling,constructed around1980andapproximately 187 m² in size. The accommodation includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen/dining,loungeand rumpus room.Thesecondary dwelling is approximately 60 m² in size,comprising two bedrooms and an open plan kitchen/living area.Thedefendanthaslivedon the Tennyson property sinceher parentshadpurchased itin 1996. Onhermarriage to ChristopherPeetersin 2014,thecoupletook up residence in the secondarydwelling.TheplaintiffalsoresidedontheTennysonproperty with his wife from 1997 to 2001 and again from early 2005 to November 2006(thenwith his wife and three children). Theyhadmoved out only once theyhadpurchased a home in Victoria.BackgroundAlleged conversationIn or about April 2019(i.e.relatively contemporaneous with theexecutionof the deceased’sWill),the defendant contendsthatshe hadaconversation with her parents at the kitchen table as follows:3.In about April 2019, when Dad was suffering from cancer, I had a conversation withmy parents at the kitchen table in their house at Tennyson in words to the followingeffect:Mum:“We want to have a discussion with you to put your mind at rest as wellas ours. Since Dad has found out that he’s unwell, we wanted to makesure that anything Dad wants sorted is done now.We have been to see Donto finalise our wishes if anything happenssuddenly to Dad or both of us. I am concerned about the property andwanted my wishes to be formalised.”…5.The conversation continued in words to the effect of:Mum:“I want you to be protected. This is what Dad and I have spoken toDon about. What we have discussed with Don and put in our Wills iswhat we would like to happen.We’ve left the property to you with a proviso that you are to pay to yourbrother one third of the property value at the date of our death. It isimportant that you see Don immediately when we die.”Me:“I don’t know how I would raise the money to pay Matthew.”Mum:“Do you think you would be able to get a home loan on the propertybecause the bank will need security to approve the loan?”Me:“I think I’ll be able to do that.”Mum:“We’ve given you twoyear’s timeto decide whether you want to havethe property and to raise the funds. If you decide during that time thatyou don’t want the property, then it will form part of the estate.”Me:“I’m worried about what Matthew might feel about that.”Dad:“It shouldn’t be a problem. Matthew doesn’t have any interest in theproperty given that he lives inVictoriaand he’s well established downthere.”The defendant was not cross-examined on the conversation.I accept her evidence that the conversation took place in the formto which she has deposed.Thereference to Don is a reference to theparents’solicitor,Mr Shaddick, who is also the solicitor for the defendant.Property valuationWithin the month after the deceased’s death,the defendanthad arrangedto obtain a valuation reportof the Tennyson propertyfrom John O’Brien,a registered residential property valuer.On 30 November 2022,Mr O’Brien inspected the property and provided a valuation report as at that date.Hevaluedthe propertyat$1.725 million.The reason for the valuationbeingas at that date is not evident.It is not a valuation as at the date of the deceased’s death.WhilstI raisedthisissuewithcounselon the hearing, neitherpartysuggested that the anomalyinthe date should be regarded as a matter of significance in the determination of theproceedings.Accordingly, without demur fromcounsel,I have proceeded on the basis that Mr O’Brien’svaluation should be regarded as beingavaluation of theTennysonproperty which the parties are content torepresentits market value asatthe date of the deceased’s death. Indeed, the correspondence between the parties’respective solicitors(which I will note below) gives no suggestion that the parties have proceeded on any other basis.Correspondenceand events leading up to theproceedingsKeating AverySolicitors hasacted for the plaintiff anda number ofrepresentatives of that firm,including MsCreamer(a solicitor),ArlindaWentworth(a law clerk) andCherieWighton(a legal assistant),have been the authors of correspondence on behalf of the plaintiff. ShaddicksLawyers hasacted for the defendant, withTheresaParry(a legal executive), Andrew Gill(a solicitor)and Mr Shaddickengagingin correspondence on behalf of the defendant.On 19 January 2023,Ms Parrysent an email tothe plaintiff attaching a copy ofMr O’Brien’svaluationreport. In the email, Ms Parrymadereferenceto what she described asthe defendant’s“option to purchase the property”andcalculated$575,000as being thesum to be paid tothe plaintiff. She noted that the defendant“is currently making enquiries to obtain a loan to pay[the plaintiff]out”.On2February2023,the plaintiff responded toMs Parry,noting that he had spoken with the defendant the prior night,and requested a copy of the probate application,including a list of assets and liabilities.As noted above, probate was grantedon 20 February2023.On2 March 2023,Ms Creamer sent a letter to Shaddicksin which shenotedthat KeatingAvery actedon behalf of the plaintiff in his capacity as a beneficiary and requesteda number ofmatters, including updates on the application for probateand all of the estate assets.Relevantly,noting cl 8.1 of theWill, Ms Creamerrequested confirmation that the defendant intends to“buyout”the plaintiff’s“one third share of the Tennyson property”and provision of details as tothearrangements and timeframe for that to occur.On 8 March 2023,Mr Shaddickresponded to KeatingAvery. While hetookissue with some of the contentions initsletter,henonetheless confirmedthat the defendant did intend to pay one-third of the value of theTennysonproperty to the plaintiff as soon as possible andthat shehad applied for finance to enable her to do so.Hisletter indicated that the defendant anticipatedhaving an approval in aboutone weekandthat his firmwouldletKeatingAvery know when finance had beenapproved,andadvisethetimeframe for payment.Between 28 April 2023 and 6 November 2023(when the proceedings were commenced),there wasextensivecorrespondence between Keating Avery and Shaddicksin relation to,amongst other things,enquiriesbyKeating Avery as to the capacity in which the defendant was seeking to borrow fundstofacilitate giving effect to the provisions of cl 8.1oftheWill. It is not necessary torecite indetailall ofthat correspondence.I set outbelowthesalientparts of the correspondencewhich includes reference to certain events regardingdealings with theTennyson property.On 28 April 2023,KeatingAverywrote to Shaddicksseeking,inter alia,details of the borrowing structure proposed by the defendantin order tomake payment of what was described as the“consideration amount”to the plaintiff.On 2 May 2023,Mr Shaddickcaused a transmission application to be lodged on behalf of the defendant with the NSWLandRegistryServices, whichrecordedthatthe defendantapplied for transmission of the Tennyson property to her in her capacity as executrix.On 10 May 2023,Ms Parrysent an email toMs Wentworthin which she notedthat she had sighted the defendant’s loan approval for $575,000. She furtherindicated thatthe defendanthad signedhermortgage documents and anticipated that theNABmay be“ready to proceed[I inferfinalisethe loanandmakefunds available to the defendant]in the next week or two”.On 17 May 2023,Ms Wentworth emailed Ms Parry seeking,inter alia,details of the capacity in which the defendant was applying fortheloan. Later that morning,Ms Parry responded by emailin which sheindicatedthat she had already advised the amount of the loan applied for and observedthat she was“not sure what more you need to know”. Ms Wentworthagainpressedthe question as to whether the defendant was borrowing“inher capacity as executoror in her personal right”.Ms Parry replied by email,noting thatthe defendantwas borrowing inher“personal right”.On 19 May 2023,Ms Parry sentanemail to Ms Wentworthattachinga draft deed of releasebetween theplaintiff and the defendant as executrix. There is no need to dwell particularly upontheproposeddeed asno party contends thatithasanyrelevance to the issues to be determined.Alsoon 19 May 2023(a Friday),the NABpaid the sum of $574,834.76 into the defendant’spersonalbank account ending 6525 and caused a mortgageto be registeredon the titleoftheTennysonproperty.WhilstI will say more about thisbelow,it suffices to note that Shaddicks,byaletter to Keating Averydated 22 August 2023,contended thatin so doingthe NABignored(or was oblivious to) the fact that the defendant held theTennysonproperty in her capacity as executrix.On22 May 2023(thefollowing Monday),the defendant withdrew$575,035from her personalaccount. Of that sum,$35 was used to purchase a bank cheque: T 17.It is evident that the defendant provided the bank cheque to her solicitors to be banked to their trust account.On23 May 2023,Shaddicks’trust account records the receipt of $575,000: T 17.On31 May 2023,Ms Parrysent an email toMs Wentworth asking whether she had been able to obtain instructions in relation to theproposeddeed and noting that“we have funds ready to go and would like to finalise the matter”.On 19 and 23 June 2023,Ms Creamersent emailstoMsParrynoting that they were awaiting final instructions regarding theproposeddeed andseekingconfirmation ofanew proposed settlement date(I infer for the mortgage)and whetheraPEXAworkspace had been created.On30 June 2023,Ms Parrysent an email toMs Creamer indicatingthat no changes to the proposed deedwouldbe agreed to.Alsoon 30 June 2023,Keating Avery causedatitlesearchto be madeof the Tennyson propertyand discoveredthattransmission of the title to the defendant as executrix hadoccurred onor about19 May 2023.On4August 2023,Mr ShaddickinformedKeating Averythat thedefendant“is ready,willingand able to pay the sum of $575,000 being the amount determined in accordance with the provisions of the Will”tothe plaintiff.On22 August 2023,MrShaddickstated in hisletter to Keating Avery,inter alia,that Shaddicksheld the $575,000initstrust accountand,except forthe distribution of the estate,the defendant had completed herexecutorialduties.On 8 September 2023,Ms Creamerrespondedby lettertoShaddicksasserting,inter alia,that the defendant had advancedherposition at the expense of the plaintiff and was in clear breach of her fiduciary duties. Keating Avery demanded that the defendant account to the estate,repay the loan in full and discharge the mortgage,noting that failure to do so would leave theplaintiffwith“no alternative”other than to make an application to theCourt to revoke the grant of probate and seek the appointment of an independent administrator.On27 September 2023,Ms Creamerby email requestedthatShaddicksconfirmthat it heldinstructionstoaccept service ofcourt documents.MrShaddickconfirmed as muchthe following day.On 13October2023,Ms Creamerwrote toMr Shaddickconfirmingthat she heldinstructions to commence proceedings, which sheforeshadowed wouldoccur on or about 31 October 2023. Sherequested thatthe defendant refrain from distributing the estate until the proceedings hadbeenfinalised.On26 October 2023,Mr Shaddicksent a letterto Keating Averyenclosing:twotrust chequesin favour of the plaintiff, the firstfor the sum of $108,835.98and the second for the sum of$575,000“representinga1/3rdvalue of the property pursuant to theWill”; anda copy of a distribution statement. The letter asserted that“this now completes the administration of theestate”.According to Ms Creamer,that letter was not received by Keating Avery until 30 October 2023.On 27 October 2023,the defendant,orratherShaddickson her behalf,causedto be registereda transfer of theTennysonproperty to herselfpersonally.WillThestructure of the deceased’sWill isdividedintotwo parts:Part A,consisting ofgeneral provisions(cll1to9);andPart B,detailing theexecutor’s instructions and discretionary powers(cll10to13).In summary,the provisions of the respective parts are as follows:Part A:arevocation clause(cl1);adefinitionsclause(cl2);aclause appointing,intheeventswhichoccurred,the defendant as executrix(cl3);aclause appointing the executrix as trustee of each trust under theWill(cl4);aprovision for the executrix to hold the estate on trust(cl5);agift of personal chattels(cl6);aclause dealing with the balance of the deceased’sestate(which,having regard toHermanpredeceasing the deceased,was operative such that the remaining clauses of theWill would take effect)(cl7);aclause dealing with the distribution of the balance of the estate(cl 8);andaclause indicating the deceased’s wish that her body be cremated(cl9);Part B:aclause expressingthe deceased’s wish that herexecutrix deal withanydeath benefits in accordance with any last valid nominationthatthe deceased may have made(cl10);aclauseinrelation toprospective beneficiary testamentary trusts(cl11);aclause setting out other specific powers of the executrix and trustee(cl12);andaclause dealing withthepayment of taxes or duties(cl13).Onthehearing,counselfocusedin particular oncll5,8 and 12.I will set out the relevant parts of those clausesin fullbelow.Clause 5 of theWill is in the following terms:5.Executor to hold on Trust.5.1.My Executor shall hold the whole of my estate on trust and, subject to the powers set out in thisWill, after the:(a) selling, calling in or converting into money any part of my estate; and(b) payment of all or any debts and testamentary expenses associated with my death or the administration of myestate;shall deal with the balance of my estate as provided hereafter.Clause 8 of theWill contains fourseparateclauses.It is onlynecessary to set out in detailcll8.1,8.2and 8.3,which are as follows:8.Division and Distribution of Balance of Estate8.1.If at the date of my death I am the owner of the property situate and known as[XX]Murrays Road, Tennyson(“the Property”) I give to my daughterSAMANTHA GRACE PEETERSall my right title and interest in the Property provided that within two(2) years from the date of my death she pays to my sonMATTHEW LEE BOYDan amount equivalent to one third of the market value of that property at the date of my death, such value to be determined by a qualified real estate valuer appointed by my Executor(“the Consideration”).In the event thatmy sonMATTHEW LEE BOYDpredeceases me or fails to survive me for the said two(2) year period then the amount which wouldotherwise have been payable to him under this sub-clause of myWill shall be payable to his legal personal representative.

It has been suggested that there are two types of approaches. The first approach requires looking for the ordinary meaning of the word or passage, and is described as theliteral(otherwise referred to as the “grammatical” or “objective”) approach, while the second requires looking for the meaning intended by the Willmaker, described as theintentional(otherwise referred to as the “inferential” or “purposive”) approach: e.g. RogerKerridge (assisted by A H R Brierley),Parry andKerridge: The Law of Succession(12th ed, 2009, Sweet & Maxwell) (Parry andKerridge) at 240; David M Haines QC,Construction of Wills in Australia(2007, LexisNexis Butterworths) (Haines) at 35; G E Dal Pont,Interpretation of Testamentary Documents(2019, LexisNexis Butterworths) (Dal Pont) at 1.49.Theliteralapproach is premised on the notion that there is a “correct” and “proper” sense of a word in aWill, andis said to have the advantage that whenever a word appears in a Will, it means the same thing: Parry andKerridgeat 241.50.However, theintentionalapproach has prevailed in Australia: Haines at 30, 35; Dal Pont at 1.51.Thus, the object of construction of a Will is to give effect to what can be ascertained, having regard to admissible extrinsic evidence, the Willmaker intended by the words he or she used: e.g.De Lorenzo v De Lorenzo(2020) 104 NSWLR 155; [2020] NSWCA 351 at [50] per White JA (Gleeson JA agreeing), citingFell v Fell(1922) 31 CLR 268; [1922] HCA 55 (Fell v Fell)at 273-274 per Isaacs J;Perrin v Morgan[1943] AC 399 at 406 per Viscount Simon LC, 416 per LordThankerton.52.Whilst attempting to encapsulate in a shorthand form two approaches to construction, the above-mentioned labels may be misleading as to what may betaken into accountin the task of construing Wills.53.To be clear, whilst theliteral(“grammatical”/“objective”) approach has been rejected in Australia, it would be wrong to conclude that grammatical considerations play no part in the proper approach to the construction of Wills. Conversely, theintentionalapproach does not seek to subjectively, as distinct from objectively, ascertain what the Willmaker intended from the words appearing in their context and against the backdrop of admissible extrinsic evidence: Dal Pont at 1.54.This much is made clear by Issacs J inFell v Fellat 273-274 (in particular, by the first and second of the ten “incontestable” principles). Put another way, the Court discerns the Willmaker’s intended meaning from the Willmaker’sexpressedintentions; the Court does not seek to discern what the Willmaker subjectively intended ormeantto say or do when making the Will, but what the Willmakeractuallysaidby the words in the Will:Middleton v Schofield[2022] NSWSC 1454 at [17] per Robb J.55.Specifically, grammatical considerations, sentence structure and common English usage are all matters to which the Court may properly have regard in determining the Willmaker’sexpressed intentions.56.Moreover, the exercise of reading the Will as a whole instrument may, in appropriate cases, reveal a scheme which the deceased had conceived for dealing with the estate, which in turn assists in discerning intention:Fell v Fellat 273-274 (the second principle);Fairbairn vVarvaressos(2010) 78 NSWLR 577; [2010] NSWCA 234 (Fairbairn) at [19] per Campbell JA (Macfarlanand Young JJA agreeing), citing Powell J inCooreyv George(Supreme Court (NSW), Powell J, 27 February 1986,unrep) at 14, which passage was approved by Bryson J inPerpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Wright(1987) 9 NSWLR 18 at 33.57.Where the terms of the Will are perfectly clear, searching for the scheme may be of little use, but where the language is obscure or the effects of a literal reading and the reasoning impliedly underlying it are startlingly unlikely, the scheme of dispositions may be very important in construing the Will:Muir v Winn[2009] NSWSC 857 at [24] per Bryson AJ.58.All ofthe counsel who appeared and made submissions properly accepted that questions of construction are essentially fact specific. In this sense, no case can truly provide any precedent for construction of a Will that subsequently comes before the Court for consideration: seeGibb-Maitland v Perpetual Executors Trustee & Agency Co(WA) Ltd(1947) 74 CLR 579 at 586 per Rich J; [1947] HCA 35.On the hearingthere was debateaboutthe construction of testamentary instruments addressinggifts that are subject toapaymentbeing madeto another beneficiary.Thereiscomment,analysis,principles andguides(guides)in texts dealing with the construction of testamentary instrumentsrelevant to this issue:e.g.David M HainesQC,Construction of Wills in Australia(2007,LexisNexisButterworths)(Haines)at 268.Iwill set out belowsome of those guides.However, it is important to understandwhat guides are andthe rolewhich theyplay in the construction of testamentary instruments.Guides to constructionarenot random rules without any rational basis.Rather,theyaretruths,propositionsorchainsofreasoningthatover time have been identified bycourts(orcommentators)because theyhave served toidentify thelegal effect of different potential meaningsgiven to the words used by Willmakers.Guidescan alsoprovide an independent means of testingthelikely intentionof the Willmakerin cases wherea number ofcompeting plausible interpretations present themselves.In doing so,guides often reflect probabilities as to the likely intentionsof Willmakers baseduponcommonexperienceof how humans think and act in life.Oftenthe assistance of such guidesis limited and may beexhausted bysimply identifyingtheplausible alternative constructionsandperformingsome testing ofthoseconstructions to inclinethe judge’s mindin any given case toward or against a particular outcome.Thus, ultimately suchguidesmerelyserve toassistjudges in the process of determining the proper construction of a Will,as distinct fromdirectingorcompellingaparticularconstruction outcome.Hainesrefers toa number ofdecisions involving gifts that were subject to a payment being made to another, includingRe Lester; Lester v Lester[1942] Ch 324(Re Lester), which Mr Pricecited.In that case,the testator bequeathed shares intwo companies tooneof his sons,“subject to”thepayment by him of anannuity to another son,in the first instance,anda number ofother successive annuitiesthereafter.Simonds J considered that the parties hadrightly conceded that the Will imposed a personal obligation on the legatee to make the payment and, contrary to what had been submitted, there was no ground for saying that in addition a charge on the subject matter of the legacy had been created:Re Lesterat 326-328.InReGardiner(deceased); GardinervGardiner[1971]2NSWLR 494(Re Gardiner),the deceased gave the whole of his estate tooneof his sons“subject to”himpaying the sum of£1,000 to another son within two years from the deceased’s death. The first son did not make the payment within the time specified, and the second son sought a determination as to whether the gift to the first son had failedsuch that,in the absence of a gift over,the estate devolvedason an intestacy.Anumber ofquestions were posed for determination. The first question,asidentifiedbyHelshamJ,was whether theprovisions of the Willimposed a condition or some other legal characterisation such as a trust,chargeor personal obligation.HisHonourmade referenceto a number of cases,includingReLester. On the facts ofRe Gardiner,Helsham Jdetermined that the intention was that the giftwas subject to a condition such that itwould fail if the money was not paid within the prescribed time.However,it is clearthathisHonour found the construction vexingand he notedthat,whilst the facts of the case were very simple, they seemedtohim to raise extraordinarily difficult questions of law:Re Gardinerat 495C.I think the same may be said for this case.The law distinguishes between conditions which are precedent or subsequent.Generally speaking, inthe case of a condition precedent,the conditionis construedasrequiringperformancebefore the beneficiary takes any interestin the property the subject of the gift.Conversely,acondition subsequentis construed asoperatingonly in defeasance of an interest given to a beneficiary:In reCumings; Nicholls v Public Trustee(South Australia)(1945) 72 CLR 86 at 91 per Latham CJ; [1945] HCA 32.Nonetheless, in either case,it is necessary to look at the precise words of the provision creating the condition and toascertain the intention of the testatrix from the words shehasused,having regard to admissible extrinsic evidence.As a guide, Hainessuggests that whereacondition is capable of being performed immediately it is a condition precedent,but if time is required or expected it will be subsequent:Hainesat 271.There is also a disinclination of courts to construeagift as being subject to forfeiture if a different meaning can be fairly given to the words used:e.g.GEDal Pont,Interpretation of TestamentaryDocuments(2019,LexisNexisButterworths)(Dal Pont)at 312. Indeed,inKautervKauter[2003]NSWSC741,whilst referring toHelsham J’sdecision inRe Gardiner,Young CJ inEq(ashis Honour then was) observedat [54]that there are cases going the other way.His Honournotedthat equity tends to construe conditionsasnot involvingaforfeiture butascapable of being“policed by specific performance, injunction, or equitable compensation”,citingR P Meagher and W MGummow,Jacobs’ Law of Trusts in Australia(6thed, 1997, Butterworths) at[232].Further,where there is doubt as to the date or timeof vesting,courts tend to lean towards a construction that a gift vests at the earliest date which is possible in accordance with the words of theWill.Isaacs J expressedthepresumptioninthe following terms inWyatt v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd(1917) 23 CLR 14 at 19;[1917] HCA 16(Wyatt):In this will there are no technical expressions, and there is no canon of construction to be applied except the fundamental rule that a man’s testamentary intentions must be judged of by the words he uses, having regard to the subject matter. His untechnical words must receive their ordinary natural meaning, unless he himself has in some way indicated a special meaning. Apart from that, there is only one legal principle to bear in mind, and that is that in case of doubt the Court leans to an early indefeasible vesting, where not inconsistent with the natural meaning of words. That is not an arbitrary principle: it is only applying what the Court assumes is natural in the mind of a testator—to have as much certainty about his dispositions as is consistent with his expressed wishes.BothHaines(at53) andDalPont(at 61) expressly refer to thatpresumption,in each casemaking referenceto the decision of Isaacs J inWyatt.Issue 1–Whatis the proper construction of cl 8.1?SubmissionsMs Glover submitted that there was no real dispute between the parties as to the meaning of a word or clause of theWill,the effect of theWill or a provision ofit: POS[55]. In relation to cl 8.1, MsGlover submitted as follows(POS [58]-[60], footnotes omitted):58. An examination of the Will discloses a scheme as to the outcome intended by the deceasedas to the distribution of her estate. The Property was not an absolute gift to the FirstDefendant. Clause 8.1 of the Will sets out the scheme, namely the First Defendant wouldhold the Property in her capacity as executor of the estate and was afforded a 2-year periodin which to pay the Plaintiff a one third value of the Property as determined by a marketvaluer. If for whatever reason the First Defendant did not elect to make payment to thePlaintiff, the Property would fall into residue. To adopt an alternate meaning would be torender the last three lines of clause 8.1 a nullity. It must be asked “what work” the last threelines of clause 8.1 does within the relevant provision.59. There is no power in clause 12 of the Will that engages on the facts. The specific powers setout in clause 12 of the Will are powers of the Executor and Trustee, not powers given to theFirst Defendant in her personal capacity.60. The Plaintiff submits that on a true construction of the Will, the First Defendant was notpermitted to use the estate Property, as security to borrow funds in her personal capacity topay the Plaintiff one third of the market value of the Property as at the date of death of thedeceased.For his part,Mr Price’ssubmissionsin relation to the construction of cl 8.1wereas follows(DOS [11]-[15]):11.The clear intent of the testatrix in clause 8.1 was that:(a)the plaintiff was to receive one-third of the market value of theTennyson property within 2 years of the death of the testatrix; and(b)the first defendant was to receive the Tennyson property.12.It was only if the first defendant “fails” or “decides not to pay the Consideration” to the plaintiff that the property falls to residue.13.It is clear that thefirst defendant had not decided “not to pay”. It is also clear that the first defendant had not “failed” to pay.14.The plaintiff’s argument is premised on the first defendant having obtained a benefit. The first defendant’s acts did not result in her obtaining a benefit. She has received what was directly and expressly contemplated by clause 8.1 of the will.15.Accordingly, there was no breach by the first defendant of her fiduciary duties.In elaborating on her written submissions,Ms Glover submitted that there was nothing within the language used in cl 8 which raises any ambiguityor is meaningless in some way,andthere is nothing within cl 8 or the Will itselfupon which it could be implied that the defendant,in her personalcapacityasbeneficiary,was entitled to mortgage theTennysonproperty for a personal loan,whether that loanbe for the purposes ofthe“consideration payment”in cl 8.1 or for any other purpose.Ms Glovercontended(asthe plaintiff’s solicitorshadin a letter to the defendant’s solicitors on 15 August 2023) that the condition is a condition precedent: T22.9-.10. Shesubmitted(T19.29-.34)that cl 8:… is not an absolute[gift]to the defendant, but there is a condition that must be satisfied, and it’s implicit in 8.1 that the defendant would hold the property in her capacity as executor, and if the gift were perfected and the consideration paid within that two year period, only then would the right title and interest in the property pass to her in her capacity as beneficiary.Mr Price rejected thecontentionthat therequirement for the consideration to be paidwasa condition precedentto the transfer of theTennysonproperty: T 29.46-.48.Whether or notthe condition to which the gift to the defendant in cl 8.1 wassubject wasa condition precedent(as she contended), Ms Glovercontended that, if the condition was not satisfied within the requisitetwo yearperiod, forfeiture of the gift would result and the Tennyson property would fall into residue. For his part, Mr Price appeared to initially accept that position, but later contended that the condition merely imposed a personal obligation on the defendantsimilar tothat inRe Lester: T 30.Significance of the proper constructionA number ofquestionsarise in relation to the construction of cl 8.1. They include(a)whether the giftis subject to a condition precedent or subsequent,which is relevant to when(if at all) the gift vestsin the defendant,and(b)what istheconsequence of the defendant failing to comply with the payment of the consideration.Whilst these are important questions,neitherof themisofitselfcompletelydefinitive of the parties’claims,for two reasons.First, thetime periodfor the payment of the consideration has not yet elapsed.Secondly,Ms Glover acknowledged that the characterisation of the terms of the gift in cl 8 as being a condition precedent or otherwise would not, of itself, determine the outcome of the proceedings,as there was the second issue which arose as to whetherthe defendantwas permitted“as beneficiary”to use the estate property as security for a loan: T 25.28-.33.Structure of cl 8.1Clause 8.1 deals completely with thedisposition of theTennysonproperty. Itcontains three sentences which addresshow that is to occur.The first sentence providesfora gift of the property on a proviso,towhich I will return.The second sentence addresses an event which has not occurred. Neithercounselcontendedthat this sentence wasrelevantly engaged on the facts of the case.In its terms, the third sentence addresses what is to occur in relation to the property if the defendant fails or decides not to pay the consideration within the time specified in the first sentence.Consequences of non-payment–forfeiture or otherwise?I accept that the condition in cl 8.1 involves forfeiture of the gift to the defendant for non-fulfilment. The fact that the third sentence expressly provides for the Tennyson property to fall into residue if the defendant fails to make the payment to the plaintiff within the time specified makes this condition distinguishable fromthat inRe Lester. The deceased’s provision for a gift over should the defendant not fulfil the condition is probative of her intention to create a condition going to forfeiture: Dal Pont at [11.8], citingNathan v Leonard[2003] 1 WLR 827 at 830-838 per John Martin QC(sitting as a deputy High Court judge).Time of vesting – is the consideration payment a condition precedent or subsequent?On this question,thesurrounding circumstances are important.The defendant had been livingon theTennysonproperty for approximately23years(and was continuingto live at the property)atthe time of the making of theWill, meanwhilethe plaintiff had not livedon the property for a period of approximately12.5yearsand was living independently in Victoria(although Iaccepthe had at times livedon theTennysonpropertypreviously).The conversationdeposed to by the defendantbetweenherand her parents(andin particular thedeceased)took place,I infer,shortlyafter the timeat whichthe Willwasmade.In the conversation,thedefendantraised with her parents,and in particular the deceased,thefact that she did not then know how she would raisethemoney to pay theplaintiffthe one-third value of the Tennyson property.Inher response to thedefendant, the deceasedenvisaged the possibility thatthedefendantmay be able to get a home loan on the property,recognising thatthe bank would need security to approve any loan.Accepting as I do thatthe conversation took place slightly after the deceasedhadmade her Will,it seems likely that the conversation confirmed to the deceased the probability,or at least the possibility,that the defendant,upon the deceased’s eventual death,wouldneed to borrow fundsin order tomake the considerationpayment.Having regard to that evidenceproviding context, Iincline against a constructionthat the condition in cl 8.1 was intended to be a condition precedent;rather,Ilean to a constructionthat itwas intended to be a conditionsubsequentsuch that the defendant’s interest would vest in possession prior to the condition being fulfilled.It has been said that where a specific time is mentioned for the performance of the condition but not for the vesting of the interest, the condition will in general be subsequent:In re Porter; Logan v Northern Bank Ltd[1975] NI 157(RePorter)at 160 perLowry LCJ.Moreover,if it is reasonable to suppose that the interest must vestin possession before thedoneecan be expected to comply with the condition, it will besubsequent: Dal Pont at [11.15], citingRePorterat 160.Anyremaining lack of clarity as to the deceased’s intention would incline the Court towardsconstruing the gift as subject toa condition subsequent, giving effect to the rationale for a presumption in favour of early vesting: Dal Pont at [11.14];Re Porterat 160.Significantly, as I have noted,theconsequences of non-fulfilment of the condition arelargely mootat thisstagebecause thetime periodfor the performance of the conditionin cl 8.1has not yet expiredand the defendant has made it clear through her legal representatives that she isready, willing and able, and indeed has already attempted, to pay the consideration amount to the plaintiff.Issue 2 – Was the defendant’s use of the property as security to borrow fundspermitted?SubmissionsMs Glover submitted that it was important to establish the capacity in which the defendanthadborrowedthe funds from the NABin ordertopay the consideration.Shenoted thatthe defendant admits in her defencethatsheborrowedthefunds from the NABin her personal capacity.Ms Glover submittedthat it was impermissible for the defendant as executrix to use theTennysonproperty as securityin that manner,as there was no relevant powerincl 12 of the Will(or otherwise)whichpermittedthe defendantto act as she did in her personal capacity:POS[59].According toMs Glover,it is undisputed that as at 19 May 2023:(a)the defendant in her capacity as executrix was recorded as the registeredproprietorof theTennysonproperty;(b)the defendant in a personal capacity borrowed funds from the NAB,using the property as collateral security; and(c)the NABregisteredamortgage on the titleoftheTennysonproperty,paying the loan monies to the defendant personally: POS[30]. She further acknowledged or accepted in argument that,had the defendantgone to the NAB and asked toborrow the $575,000in her capacity as executrix,after which the NAB paid the monies into an estate bank account, that would have been permissible under the Will:T 26.22-.45.Ms Glover submittedthat cl 12.1,andin particularcl12.1(q),did not permit the defendant as executrix to allow herself as beneficiary to use estate assets to secure a personal loan.Shesubmitted that,if thedeceasedhad wished to give such a power to the defendant,she could have specifically done so and framed cl 8.1 in terms that permitted her to borrow funds in her personal capacity. However, she submitted that thedeceasedhad not donesoand that,by cl 12.1of the Will,shehad specifically limited any borrowing power to the defendantinher capacity as trustee or executrix of the estate: T 20.30-.36.In the context of the list of powers in cl 12.1,that submission calls to mind the guide to construction“expressiounisestexlusioalterius”(the express mention of one is to the exclusion of the other).I pause to note that it has often been said that theexpressiounismaxim is one that should be applied with caution:e.g.Wentworth v New South Wales Bar Association(1992) 176 CLR 239at250perDeane, Dawson, Toohey andGaudronJJ;[1992] HCA 24.Even so,it wouldberarefora Willmaker to givea beneficiary(as distinct from an executrix or trustee)a power to deal with property under a Will. Ordinarily,there is no relevant need to do so.Meanwhile,Mr Pricesubmittedthat theargumentthat an absence of power can be inferred from the fact that there is no express mentionof itin a document(citing thedecision of thePrivy Council inThe Bombay Tramway CompanyLtdv The Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay[1904] UKPC 29, in the contractual context)had been discredited. It is not obvious to me that the Board’s decisiongives effect tothat proposition.In respect of cl 12.1(e),Ms Glover accepted that the words“otherwise deal with any property”constitutean extremely broadstatement,butsubmitted thatitwould not extend to allowing the defendant in her capacity as beneficiary to borrow monies from a bank in that capacity,and then for the estate property to be mortgagedfor that purpose: T 34.40-.44.According to Ms Glover, borrowingthe monies in her personal capacity with the Tennyson property as securitymeant that the defendanthasacted in breach of her fiduciary duties,“has favoured her own interest and failed to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries in the estate”: POS [61]; see also T 25.For his part,Mr Price submittedthatthe plaintiff’sargument represents a triumph of form over substance, relying uponParkin v Thorold(1852) 16Beav59 at 66-67; 51 ER 698 at 701 per Lord RomillyMRandAMEV-UDC Finance Ltd v Austin(1986) 162 CLR 170 at 197per DeaneJ; [1986] HCA 63.Specifically,he submitted thattheWill conferredapower on the defendant as executrix to borrow and use estate property as security,and that equity will not intervene to invalidate her borrowing in a personal capacity,there beingno material difference to the outcome if the defendant had borrowed the money in her capacity as executrix:DOS[21].Mr Price further submittedthat,pursuant to cl 12.1(e),the defendant had powersasexecutrix to“use”or“otherwise deal with any real or personal property…on whatever terms[she]thinks fit”and that,accordingly,it was open to her to havetheTennysonpropertymortgagedas she did:DOS[22].DeterminationWhile the defendant’s solicitors had indicated in correspondence, and the defendant admitted in her defence, that she had borrowed themoniesin her personal capacityfrom the NAB in order to pay the plaintiff,overallthere was a lack of precisionin both parties’casesas to exactly what that meant.Regrettably, the loan agreement between the defendant and the NAB was not in evidence. Nonetheless, at the time that the mortgage was registered in May 2023, the defendant held the fee simple estate in the Tennyson property as executrix. As the mortgage document lodged by the NAB shows, it was the fee simple estate which was being mortgaged.The capacity in which a party contracts, is given rights or assumes or becomes subject to obligations or liabilities under a contract, must be determined objectively in the same manner as the contract itself is construed:InfigoII Pty Ltd vLinmasHoldings Pty Ltd[2023] NSWSC 755(Infigo) at [51];Huntley Management Ltd vTimbercorpSecurities Ltd(2010) 187 FCR 151; [2010] FCA 576(Timbercorp) at [53] perRaresJ. Whilst a party to a contract can seek to identify the capacity in which the party contracts, a party cannot deem their relationship or the capacity in whichtheparty contracts to be something that it is not:Infigoat [53];Timbercorpat [57]. In this case, that task isobviouslyinhibited by the fact that the loan agreement was not in evidence.One must bear in mind that the legal personality of a trustee is unitary; although a trustee has duties specific to her status as such, when it comes to the consequences of contractual arrangements between a trustee and third parties the law does not generally distinguish between her personal and her fiduciary capacity:Investec Trust(Guernsey) Ltd vGlenallaProperties Ltd[2019] AC 271(Privy Council)(Investec) at [59(iii)] per Lord Hodge(Lord Sumption and LordCarnwathagreeing). It follows that the trustee assumes those liabilities personally and without limit, however such liabilities may be limited by contract:Investecat [59(iii)-(iv)].The principle is not relevantly different in the case of an executrixin respect of liabilities incurred after the deceased’s death: see e.g. G E Dal Pont,Law of Executors and Administrators(2022, LexisNexis) at [15.21]-[15.25].The question of whether a person or entity acts as trustee or in some other capacity is relevant to the internal question, as between trustee and beneficiary, as to whether the trustee has a right of recoupment from the trust fund for any liability it may incur.That is not an issue in which third parties usually have anylegitimate involvement:AMP Capital InvestorsLtdv Parsons Brinckerhoff Australia Pty Ltd;Retail Employees Superannuation PtyLtdv AMP Capital InvestorsLtd[2013] NSWSC 1633 at [16] per Pembroke J.Further, as Lindsay J observed inValverde v Inch[2018] NSWSC 366;(2019) 19 BPR 39421 at [103]-[104]:103. Because theReal Property Act(Torrens) system of registered title is not a system of registration of title but a system of title by registration(Breskvar v Wall(1971) 126 CLR 376 at 385-386), where a person, in the character of an executor, secures registration on the title to land under the Act, unless there is an entry on the title that the land is held in a fiduciary capacity(such as may be authorised by section 12(1)(f) of the Act as an exception to the principle, embodied in section 82 of the Act, that trusts are not recorded in the Register), for the purposes of any dealing with the land the executor, as registered proprietor, is deemed to be absolute proprietor of the land:Real Property Act, sections 42 and 96.104. Nevertheless, as section 96 of theReal Property Actconfirms, the Act is consistent with a beneficiary’s entitlement to enforce equitable rights against a registered proprietor who acquired registration(and, accordingly,viasections 41 and 42 of theReal Property Act, legal title) as an executor and who – whether in the character of an executor or in the character of a trustee– continues to hold that title.What the defendant meantby“in her personal capacity”,in the circumstances which unfolded,appears to belimited to the factthat shewould(and has been) paying interest on the borrowed fundswithout recoupment ofthoseinterestexpensesfrom theestate: seeMr Price’s submission atT 28.41-.42.Once this is made clear, and in light of Ms Glover’sacknowledgement thatit would have been permissible under the Will forthe defendantto havegone to the NAB and asked to borrow the $575,000 in her capacity“as executrix”(which would prima facie result in her being able to recoup interest expenses out of the estate), it isdifficult to understandhow the defendant has purportedly“favoured her own interest”.Indeed,that(proper)acknowledgement underminesthe argument thatthe defendantplaced her own interests in conflict with her duty as executrix, asit is premised uponher dutypermittingher to do precisely what she had in fact done.In any case,it is open toatestatrix in making aWill to permit action that would otherwise be prohibited by reason of being a breach of fiduciary duty.Specifically, if a testatrix wishes to impose on atrustee or executrixaduty which is inconsistent withapre-existing interest or duty,thetrustee or executrix is not debarred from accepting theofficeor performing the duties which are imposed under it:Mordecai v Mordecai(1988) 12 NSWLR 58 at 66G-67D per Hope JA;PrincessAnnof HessevField(1963) 80WN(NSW) 66 at 73 per Jacobs J; GE DalPont,Law ofSuccession(3rded, 2021,LexisNexis) at [12.23].Forexample,anexecutrix maybepermitted,in accordance with the terms of theWill,topurchase or retain estate property in circumstances in which,absent any such permission,the conduct would give rise to a conflict for the executrix.In construing cl 12.1(as with cl 8.1), the context of themaking of the Will is important.If the deceased wished the defendant to have an opportunity to retain the Tennyson property(which I accept), it is likely that the deceased would have intended to facilitate a process to ensure that the defendant received a home, and the plaintiff was paid his consideration, by permitting the Tennyson property to be used as security to raise funds to pay the consideration. Put another way, it is unlikely that the deceased would have wished for the defendant to retain the Tennyson property but inhibited or limited her means and options of effectivelybeing able to do so.The powers set out in cl 12.1 of the Will,in context,arepowers to facilitatethepurposes specified or envisaged by the Will and to facilitate the execution ofthetrustscreated by theWillandthedisposition of property.Facilitatingagift to a beneficiary beingeffected,by enabling that beneficiary tosatisfya condition of the gift,ought tofall within that description.Indeed, as noted above, that much was acknowledged by Ms Glover.The combined scope of the powers incll12.1(e) and(q) is extremely broad, something which was accepted by Ms Glover.The plaintiff has asked the Court to decide whethertheWillpermittedthe defendantinher personal capacity to borrow funds from the NABin order tomake therequiredpayment of theconsideration, using the Tennyson property as security.In light ofwhat I have said above, I consider that the plaintiff placed undue emphasis on what was said to have done been in the defendant’s“personal capacity”, without clarifying precisely what that meant.Rather, the relevant question is whetherthe defendant had power under the Will todo what she did, being to mortgage the Tennyson propertyin order toraise funds to pay the consideration amount to the plaintiff.Framing the question in that way,it would appear that theexpress power in cl12.1(q) to“borrow, raise moneys from and to secureby mortgage…the payment, repayment or advances of any money to any persons”permitted the defendantto mortgage the Tennyson property in order to raise funds to pay the consideration amount to the plaintiff. In any case,such action seems to me to amply fall within concept of the executrix being empoweredwithin cl 12.1(e)to“use…or otherwise deal with any realor personalproperty…on whatever terms as the trustee thinks fit”.Thephrasalverb“deal with”isdefined in broad terms in theOxford EnglishDictionary,online ed,being:a. to deal with: to actin regard to, administer, handle, dispose in any way of(a thing). b. to handle effectively; to grapple with; to take…I find that the defendant was permitted as executrix, pursuant tocll12.1(e) and(q), to act in themanner in whichshe did, being to mortgage the Tennyson property in order to facilitate a beneficiary(in this case herself) raising sufficient funds tosatisfy thecondition of a gift, being topay the consideration to the plaintiff. Those actions were clearly for a purpose envisaged by the Will.In the above circumstances, I do not find that there has been any breach by the defendant in her capacity as executrix of any applicable fiduciary duty. For the sake of completeness, I note that there is no suggestion that the defendant in her personal capacity owed any fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.Issue 3–Shouldthe grant of probate be revoked?Ms Glover made detailed submissions in relation to the circumstances in which a grant of probate may be revoked.Whilst I have read and considered Ms Glover’ssubmissions,in lightofmy findings in relation to the construction of theWill and the issue regarding alleged breach of fiduciary duty,there is no circumstance that arises towarrant any revocation of the grant of probate in favour of the defendant.OrdersMs Glover did not dispute that,in the event thattheCourt found there was no breach of fiduciary duty,the declaration sought by the defendant in the cross-claim wasappropriate.Accordingly,I will make the declaration as sought by the defendant.On the question of costs,provisionallyitseems to me that there was a contestable issue as to the true construction of theWill,and in particular the provisions ofcll8.1 and 12.1.In those circumstances,my provisional view is that the costs of the defendantshouldbe paid out of the estate on the indemnity basis and the costsof the plaintiffand Mr Emanuel(as a submitting defendant)shouldbepaid out of the estate on the ordinary basis.Thosecostsareto be paid out of residue.If the parties wish tocontendfor some other costsorder,I will give them an opportunity to doso.The orders of theCourt are as follows.Declarethat, on the proper construction of the will of the late Elaine Fay Boyd(the“Deceased”) made on 24 April 2019, the defendantwas permitted tomortgage thereal property located at and known asXXMurrays Road, Tennyson in the State of New South Wales(having certificate oftitle folio identifierX/XXXXX)(the“Property”) for the purpose of raising funds to pay the plaintiff one-third of the market value of the Property as at the date of death of the Deceased in accordance with clause 8.1 of the Deceased’s will.Order that the plaintiff’s costsand the costs of Mr Emanuel(as a submitting defendant), eachon the ordinary basis,and the defendant’s costs,on the indemnity basis,be paid out of the residue of the estate.Grant liberty toanyparty to apply toMeek Jwithin 7 daysby email correspondence to theAssociate toMeek Jto vary order2,failing which the costs order will become a final order.**********Amendments18 September 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t[140(1)] - change \"allow\" to \"mortgage\"DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

However, Mr Jaworski rightly pointed out that the leave which he sought was not required to commence the proceedings but, on the case law, went to the question whether he would be entitled to retain legal representation at the cost of CAANZ."}, {"p_num": 3, "text": "It is convenientfirstto address the authorities on which Mr Jaworski relied, although he first addressed them in detail after I gave leave to reopen to do so. I have revised this judgment to reflect his further submissions in this regard.Mr Jaworski relies on the Court of Appeal’s decision inWallersteiner v Moir (No 2)[1975] 1 QB 373 (“Wallersteiner”) which is a well-known earlier decision in respect of the derivative action at general law, prior to the introduction of the present statutory derivative action regime for corporations under theAct.Mr Jaworski fairly drew attention to the observation of Lord Denning MR (at 391-392)in that casethat a minority shareholder, as an agent acting on behalf of the company, was \"entitled\" to be indemnified by the company against all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by him in the course of the agency. That proposition, of course, depends upon the existence of an agency, arising wherea minority shareholder is properly pursuing proceedings on the company's behalf. The Master of the Rolls there identified (at 392) a possible procedure to address the question of an indemnity for costs in favour of such a minority shareholder, namely that the minority shareholder, soon after issuing the proceedings,should apply for the sanction of the Court in somewhat the same way as a trustee does, by applying ex parte for directions supported by an opinion of Counsel as to whether there is a reasonable case or not. The Master of the Rolls noted that:"}, {"p_num": 4, "text": "There are two difficulties with Mr Jaworski's reliance on this approach here. The first is that Mr Jaworski has not taken the course which Lord Denning MR contemplated, namely that the application brought ex parte should be supported by an opinion of Counsel. I recognise that Mr Jaworski indicates he has not done so because he cannot afford the costs of legal representation; but that has the significant consequence that the Court is deprived of the independent view of the merits of the proceedings which an independent opinion of Counsel would provide. The second difficulty is that, while Lord Denning MR suggested that proposed approach, he made clear that the master wasnotbound to decide the application ex parte but might do so if he or she thought fit. His Lordship also there contemplated that notice could be given to other minority shareholders; it seems to me that, by parity of reasoning, so too it could be given to the company which is the subject of the application, in whose name the proceedings are sought to be brought, and that view was taken by the majority inWallersteiner."}, {"p_num": 5, "text": "Mr Jaworski also drew attention to the observations of Buckley LJ (at 404) where his Lordship also considered that a minority shareholder could apply for directions as to whether he should proceed in such an action and to what stage without further directions, and also contemplated that such an application could be made ex parte. However, his Lordship then went on to add:"}, {"p_num": 6, "text": "These observations do not assist Mr Jaworski’s contention that this application should continue on an ex parte basis to a determination. First, the majority inWallersteinerconfined that possibility to a \"relatively simple case\", and the 200 pages of Mr Jaworski's affidavit and 500 pages of exhibits to which he hasreferred are not consistent with this being a \"relatively simple case\". Second, the majority of the Court of Appeal there expressly approved the possibility that the company could be joined as a respondent to such an application rather than it being determined on an ex parte basis."}, {"p_num": 7, "text": "Mr Jaworski also referred toOates v Consolidated Capital Services Pty Ltd(2009) 72 ACSR 506; [2009] NSWCA 183 (“Oates”). He referred, first, to the proposition, which I accept, that“leave”is not required to commence derivative proceedings, at general law, before their commencement. Instead, as Campbell JA noted(at [87]), an application, which Mr Jaworski here describes in his Summons as a \"leave\" application, is a mechanism available to a minority shareholder which is concerned about his or her potential future liability for costs and which seeks to obtain indemnity from the company in respect of such costs. I proceed on the basis that, as Mr Jaworski points out, his reference to“leave”in his Summons is directed to that matter.Campbell JA alsotherereferred to the observations inWallersteinerto which Mr Jaworski refers and towhich I have referred above. I havenotedabove that that casecontemplates, in the majority judgment of Buckley LJ and Scarman LJ, that notice may properly be given tothe affectedcompany in respect of an application of this kind, after the first ex parte mention of the matter."}, {"p_num": 8, "text": "Mr Jaworski also refers to the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland inVirgtel Ltd v Zabusky[2006] QSC 066 at [67], where the Court treated the application as seeking a \"preliminary adjudication of the competence of the proceeding\" and (at [75]) noted the difficulty in that case of convening a meeting of the relevant company, or a meeting of its board of directors, noting that an application of this kind could allow \"not insubstantial claims\" to be \"ventilated effectively\". Two things should be noted about those observations. The first is that the matter was not conducted on an ex parte basis. To the contrary, the judgment records the fact that both the applicants and the first to fifth respondents were represented. Second, the observations as to the desirability of a derivative action, where a company could not readily authorise the commencement of the proceedings, do not have the consequence that the company should not be given notice of the application and an opportunity to be heard as to whether the proposed proceedings should be conducted at its cost."}, {"p_num": 9, "text": "Mr Jaworski also refers to the observations of Finkelstein J inWood v Links Golf Tasmania[2010] FCA 570 at [9], which was a statutory derivative action,where his Honour ordered that the company indemnify the plaintiff for its costs. That, however, was an application of the statutory requirements for leave to bring a derivative action in respect of a company under theActand, second, is a rare (and possibly the only) case in which such an order has been made, amidst a multitude of cases in which, to the contrary, a shareholder has been required to indemnify the company for the costs to which it will be exposed by the proceedings in order to obtain suchleave."}, {"p_num": 10, "text": "For these reasons, while Mr Jaworski's account of the cases has been helpful, it does not support the conclusion for which he contends, that this is a simple case that it would be inappropriate to give CAANZ an opportunity to be heard as to whether Mr Jaworski should be permitted to pursue a claim at CAANZ’scost, whether to an intermediate point or in its entirety. It is important, in that respect, thatMr Jaworski does not provide the Court with the assistance of any Counsel’s opinion, as contemplated byWallersteiner,as to the prospects of the claim that he seeks to bring on CAANZ’s behalf and at its cost. Absent such an opinion, the Court’s assessment of that matter would be better informed if CAANZ is allowed an opportunity to be heard and make submissions in that regard."}, {"p_num": 11, "text": "With this background, the question which arises in the application is a narrow one, namely whether Mr Jaworski should be required to serve the Summons on CAANZ before any determination of any question as to whether he should be entitled to pursue the proceedings further at CAANZ’s cost."}, {"p_num": 12, "text": "Mr Jaworski reliesonhis affidavit dated 28 June 2024 which is some 194 pages in length part of which is in the nature of submissions. I have, consistent with the usual practice ofJudges in this Court, undertaken a preliminary review of that affidavit before coming on to the bench, and the affidavit has now been read by Mr Jaworski in the course of the hearing this morning. It seems to me that the matters which are in issue do not depend upon a detailed review of the allegations made in that affidavit, at least unless and until CAANZ is allowed an opportunity tobe heard as to those matters, beforethe Courtdetermineswhether Mr Jaworskishould be permitted topursue the proceedings further at its cost."}, {"p_num": 13, "text": "I should, however, note the matters which Mr Jaworski has raised in the course of submissions which are directed to the proposition that the Court should grant the relief he seeks on an ex parte basis, without CAANZ being given any opportunity to be heard as to those matters."}, {"p_num": 14, "text": "First, Mr Jaworski submits that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to require the Summons to be served on CAANZ to allow it an opportunity to respond to the allegations, before determining whether Mr Jaworski can pursuethe proceedings further at its cost. Plainly, that question needs to be determined in the particular circumstances, but it needs to be determined in the context that procedural fairness would ordinarily require that a party against which relief is sought, here to permit proceedings to be conductedon CAANZ’s behalf andat its cost, should be given the opportunity to be heard as to whether that relief should be granted. I recognise that Mr Jaworski points to several matters that he submits are such that procedural fairness is excluded here, and I will address those matters below."}, {"p_num": 15, "text": "Second, Mr Jaworski submits that CAANZ is not incorporated under theActbut under Royal Charter, and that that may limit protections afforded to its shareholders under theActalthough protections will still be available at general law. I assume, without deciding, that that is the case, and that the question whether the orders sought by Mr Jaworski should be made will be determined by general law principles which existed prior to the introduction of the statutory regime for derivative actions under theAct, to which I referred above. That, however, is not sufficient to excludethe desirability ofprocedural fairness, so far as relief is sought against CAANZ, to permit proceedings to be conductedon its behalfat its cost."}, {"p_num": 16, "text": "Third, Mr Jaworski submits that the officers of CAANZ have effective control of it and have acted in a manner that is oppressive and prejudicial to the interests of its members and inconsistently with the purpose of CAANZ of promoting transparency and accountability. It must be recognised that that is an allegation; CAANZ may well not agree with that characterisation of the conduct of its officers; and potentially, the officers themselves may not agree with that characterisation, although they have not been presently joined as party to the proceedings to give them any opportunity to respond to it."}, {"p_num": 17, "text": "Fourth, Mr Jaworski submits that, when the officers of CAANZ are accused of wrongdoing, it is unfair for them to use the resources of CAANZ to respond to that allegation. That proposition plainly depends upon the existence of a basis for the allegation of misconduct and it also depends on the way in which CAANZ responds to the allegations against its officers. For example, it would becommon and desirable practice, where such an allegation is made, for an organisation to appoint an independent board committee comprised of persons against whom the allegation is not made, or adopt some other mechanism of corporate governance,to allow decisions to be made by persons who do not have an interest in the matter. Whether CAANZ would take that course remains to be seen, but it will not have the opportunity to do so unless it is afforded an opportunity to be heard before the relief sought by Mr Jaworski is granted. No doubt, if CAANZ, under the control of the alleged wrongdoers were to expend its resources in their defence, that might be a matter which warranted intervention by the Court. But whether CAANZ will do so is a matter that is yet to emerge and cannot emerge unless it has the opportunity to be heard as to the relief sought."}, {"p_num": 18, "text": "Fifth, Mr Jaworski submits, by reference toWallersteinerto which I referred above, that a company's resources can or should be used to provide legal representation in an action broughtinthe company's name againstits officers. I accept that that is a potential order but it is not an order that should be made in every case or without any inquiry into the merits of the allegations. In particular, it is not apparent that every person who wishes to bring a derivative action against a body other than a corporation, irrespective of the merits of the allegations to be made, should be funded by that body in doing so. Plainly, that proposition requires at least a preliminary inquiry as to the merits of the allegation, and the majority inWallersteinerrecognised that it may be appropriate to allow the body to be heard in respect of that preliminary inquiry, albeit there may be constraints on the manner in which the body makes relevant corporate decisions as to how to respond to the allegations made."}, {"p_num": 19, "text": "Sixth, Mr Jaworski submits that CAANZ should be legally represented but that the process is forcing him to represent CAANZ. I do not accept that submission where the process has, at least in the form that the Summons contemplates, two stages. The first is the application that Mr Jaworski has brought for approval to bring a derivative action with funding to be provided by CAANZ in which he is entitled to represent himself and has done so. The second is astage by which, if Mr Jaworski is allowed such approval, then he (acting on behalf of CAANZ) can be legally represented at its cost."}, {"p_num": 20, "text": "Seventh, Mr Jaworski submits that his affidavit shows a prima facie case against the alleged wrongdoers. However, the difficulty with drawing inferences from that affidavit, without allowing the parties against whom such inferences are to be drawn an opportunity to be heard, is that it is inconsistent with procedural fairness, and this is not a simple case of the kind contemplated as one possibility inWallersteiner. It is a matter of common experience that perceptions may differ, so CAANZ might, for example, consider that there are other matters which are relevant, in explanation of its officers’conduct, in addition to those to which Mr Jaworski has pointed. To reach a conclusion whether as to the strength of the proposed claim without allowing CAANZ an opportunity to be heard, would deprive it of procedural fairness in respect of the application and undermine the reliability of that decision."}, {"p_num": 21, "text": "Eighth, Mr Jaworski points to his intention, by his affidavit, to secure justice for CAANZ in respect of its claims against the alleged wrongdoers. Again, I proceed on the basis that that is Mr Jaworski's intention but not all derivative actions are well-founded, whether under the general law or by statute, and“leave”(in the relevant sense) has been granted both in the United Kingdom and in Australia in some applications and not in others. Again, that contemplates a process to determine whether such leave should be granted, in which procedural fairness is an important component of that process at least in a complex case. Mr Jaworski also submits that his claims raise important public interest matters, but it seems to me that the same issues arise in that respect, namely that that is a question best determinedafterprocedural fairness is allowed to CAANZ,so far as it is affected by an application to bring the proceedingson its behalf andat its cost."}, {"p_num": 22, "text": "Ninth, Mr Jaworski submits that his affidavit presents the whole of the case and his evidence is not contested. He points to the fact that he has available about 500 pages of additional documents, in electronic form, which he would be \"happy to provide to the Court\". No doubt, those documents could be tendered,subject to any proper objection, in a hearing of Mr Jaworski’s application in due course. While Mr Jaworski's affidavit may well provide the whole of the case as he perceives it, that highlights the possibility that CAANZ may consider that other matters are relevant to the relief he seeks, beyond those which he has identified. Second, the proposition that the affidavit is not contested simply reflects the fact that CAANZ has not yet had any opportunity to respond to it, and any contest could only emerge after that opportunity was permitted to it."}, {"p_num": 23, "text": "Tenth, Mr Jaworski identifies several key matters to be dealt with in his proposed claim, including contentions that the alleged wrongdoers have acted to quash members' rights to call the board to account; that they amended the basis on which a resolution could be proposed by members to require 100 rather than 10 members as the minimum number of members to do so; that office bearers have been paid remuneration and, after a challenge to their entitlement to that remuneration, that resolution was put to an annual general meeting for approval; and that CAANZ's accounts do not \"require truth and fairness\", although it was not entirely clear whether this was an allegation that those accounts were not in fact true and fair accounts. I recognise that these allegations are made; I proceed on the basis that, if established, they are likely significant matters; however, the strength of the case, and whether CAANZ should be required to pay the costs of pursuing it, would be best determinedafterCAANZis allowed an opportunity to be heard. I note, for completeness, that Mr Jaworski also referred to a concern that, if CAANZ was joined as the defendant in proceedings brought by him personally, the directors would rely on legal professional privilege, and raised the possibility that such privilege may not be available if the action is brought by CAANZ. That question is best left for determination if and when proceedings are pursued further on CAANZ's behalf."}, {"p_num": 24, "text": "Eleventh, Mr Jaworski referred to a suggested \"Catch-22\", where legal representation is required for CAANZ but he does not have access to such legal representation at this point. There is, it seems to me, no inconsistency so as to constitute a \"Catch-22\" in that respect. As I noted above, the present application may be brought by Mr Jaworski without legal representation,although I have drawn his attention to the desirability of legal representation; if the application succeeds, the proceedings can continue on CAANZ’s behalf and funded by CAANZ, and CAANZ can be legally represented at its cost."}, {"p_num": 25, "text": "Twelfth, Mr Jaworski referred to the decision inOatesin the Court of Appeal, which in turn referred toWallersteiner, as authority that there was no need for \"leave\" to commence a derivative action, although, immediately after the action was commenced,“leave”would be sought on an ex parte basis. Mr Jaworski expanded on that proposition in the further submissions as to the case law to which I referred above. I proceed on that basis,although I recognisedabove that that is arguably not the basis on which the Summons proceeds, so far as it seeks such leave. So far as the question whether a hearing as to“leave”should take place on an ex parte basis, I have noted above that it seems to me that it would be preferable in a matter of this complex character that CAANZ have the opportunity to be heard as to whether it should be ordered to pay the costs of legal representation for Mr Jaworski (acting on its behalf) in the proposed proceedings. There is no inconsistency in that proposition, where the question of how the application is to be heard, whether on an ex parte basis or otherwise, can be determined on notice to the party affected by the application, so it at least has an opportunity to be heard as to that practical matter."}, {"p_num": 26, "text": "Thirteenth, Mr Jaworski submits that he does not have the funds to pay a legal representative and I proceed on that basis. However, Mr Jaworski, as I have noted above, is entitled to be self-represented in this aspect of the application and he is presently self-represented in this aspect of the application. Plainly, the position may differ if, ultimately, CAANZ is ordered to pay his costs of proceedings brought on its behalf.Further, and importantly, I have drawn to Mr Jaworski's attention the fact that there is a significant risk for self-represented litigants, including Mr Jaworski, who lack adequate resources to conduct litigation. While Mr Jaworski's representing himself, at this point, has the consequence that he is not incurring the costs of legal representation, he remains exposed to the costs of legal representation of CAANZ, if he is unsuccessful in respect of this application, at least where it is permitted to be heard in this application."}, {"p_num": 27, "text": "Fourteenth, Mr Jaworski submitted that the Court should read his affidavit in order to reach a conclusion as to these matters.

In those circumstances, the preferable course is to allow Mr Jaworski the option to serve the proceedings, if he wishes to do so, but stay the proceedings until that has occurred. That allows him to continue the proceedings, if he wishes to do so, but does not require him to do so if he does not wish to do so."}, {"p_num": 29, "text": "Mr Jaworski has also raised the possibility that he will seek leave to reopen, to the extent that I may not have understood the submissions that he has put or that he may wish to address further matters as to the case law, which I have addressed above.

I will make directions which will allow him the opportunity for further submissions and reserve to him the opportunity to apply for leave to reopen, while reserving the question whether such leave should be granted."}, {"p_num": 30, "text": "Accordingly, I make the following orders:"}], "full_text": "Judgment– ex tempore (Revised 19 August 2024)Nature of the application and case lawBy Summons filed on 28 June 2024, the Plaintiff, Mr Jaworski, seeks relief described as:“Grant of leave for derivative action per Request in attached Affidavit: Jaworski Chartered Accountants, Australia and New Zealand.”The relief which is sought is framed as the grant of leave to bring a derivative action, which Mr Jaworski contends would be granted in accordance with the general law, in circumstances that theDefendant,Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand(\"CAANZ\") is not a company registered under theCorporations Act2001 (Cth) (“Act”). However, Mr Jaworski rightly pointed out that the leave which he sought was not required to commence the proceedings but, on the case law, went to the question whether he would be entitled to retain legal representation at the cost of CAANZ.It is convenientfirstto address the authorities on which Mr Jaworski relied, although he first addressed them in detail after I gave leave to reopen to do so. I have revised this judgment to reflect his further submissions in this regard.Mr Jaworski relies on the Court of Appeal’s decision inWallersteiner v Moir (No 2)[1975] 1 QB 373 (“Wallersteiner”) which is a well-known earlier decision in respect of the derivative action at general law, prior to the introduction of the present statutory derivative action regime for corporations under theAct.Mr Jaworski fairly drew attention to the observation of Lord Denning MR (at 391-392)in that casethat a minority shareholder, as an agent acting on behalf of the company, was \"entitled\" to be indemnified by the company against all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by him in the course of the agency. That proposition, of course, depends upon the existence of an agency, arising wherea minority shareholder is properly pursuing proceedings on the company's behalf. The Master of the Rolls there identified (at 392) a possible procedure to address the question of an indemnity for costs in favour of such a minority shareholder, namely that the minority shareholder, soon after issuing the proceedings,should apply for the sanction of the Court in somewhat the same way as a trustee does, by applying ex parte for directions supported by an opinion of Counsel as to whether there is a reasonable case or not. The Master of the Rolls noted that:\"The master may then, if he thinks fit, straight away approve the continuance of the proceedings until close of pleadings, or until after discovery or until trial (rather as a Legal Aid committee does). The master need not, however, decide it ex parte. He can, if he thinks fit, require notice to be given to one or two of the other minority shareholders - as representative of the rest - so as to see if there is any reasonable objection.”The Master of the Rolls also there noted that a preliminary application should be simple andinexpensive and should not be allowed to escalate into a \"minor trial\".There are two difficulties with Mr Jaworski's reliance on this approach here. The first is that Mr Jaworski has not taken the course which Lord Denning MR contemplated, namely that the application brought ex parte should be supported by an opinion of Counsel. I recognise that Mr Jaworski indicates he has not done so because he cannot afford the costs of legal representation; but that has the significant consequence that the Court is deprived of the independent view of the merits of the proceedings which an independent opinion of Counsel would provide. The second difficulty is that, while Lord Denning MR suggested that proposed approach, he made clear that the master wasnotbound to decide the application ex parte but might do so if he or she thought fit. His Lordship also there contemplated that notice could be given to other minority shareholders; it seems to me that, by parity of reasoning, so too it could be given to the company which is the subject of the application, in whose name the proceedings are sought to be brought, and that view was taken by the majority inWallersteiner.Mr Jaworski also drew attention to the observations of Buckley LJ (at 404) where his Lordship also considered that a minority shareholder could apply for directions as to whether he should proceed in such an action and to what stage without further directions, and also contemplated that such an application could be made ex parte. However, his Lordship then went on to add:\"In a relatively simple case the Court may feel able to deal with the matter without joinder of any other party. When the summons comes before the Court, directions should be given as to whetherthe companyor another minority shareholder or the defendants or any of them or anyone else should be made respondents and whether any respondent should be appointed to act in a representative capacity for the purposes of the summons.\" [emphasis added]His Lordship went on to make further observations as to the possible approach and Scarman LJ (at 407) agreed with the procedure proposed by Buckley LJ.These observations do not assist Mr Jaworski’s contention that this application should continue on an ex parte basis to a determination. First, the majority inWallersteinerconfined that possibility to a \"relatively simple case\", and the 200 pages of Mr Jaworski's affidavit and 500 pages of exhibits to which he hasreferred are not consistent with this being a \"relatively simple case\". Second, the majority of the Court of Appeal there expressly approved the possibility that the company could be joined as a respondent to such an application rather than it being determined on an ex parte basis.Mr Jaworski also referred toOates v Consolidated Capital Services Pty Ltd(2009) 72 ACSR 506; [2009] NSWCA 183 (“Oates”). He referred, first, to the proposition, which I accept, that“leave”is not required to commence derivative proceedings, at general law, before their commencement. Instead, as Campbell JA noted(at [87]), an application, which Mr Jaworski here describes in his Summons as a \"leave\" application, is a mechanism available to a minority shareholder which is concerned about his or her potential future liability for costs and which seeks to obtain indemnity from the company in respect of such costs. I proceed on the basis that, as Mr Jaworski points out, his reference to“leave”in his Summons is directed to that matter.Campbell JA alsotherereferred to the observations inWallersteinerto which Mr Jaworski refers and towhich I have referred above. I havenotedabove that that casecontemplates, in the majority judgment of Buckley LJ and Scarman LJ, that notice may properly be given tothe affectedcompany in respect of an application of this kind, after the first ex parte mention of the matter.Mr Jaworski also refers to the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland inVirgtel Ltd v Zabusky[2006] QSC 066 at [67], where the Court treated the application as seeking a \"preliminary adjudication of the competence of the proceeding\" and (at [75]) noted the difficulty in that case of convening a meeting of the relevant company, or a meeting of its board of directors, noting that an application of this kind could allow \"not insubstantial claims\" to be \"ventilated effectively\". Two things should be noted about those observations. The first is that the matter was not conducted on an ex parte basis. To the contrary, the judgment records the fact that both the applicants and the first to fifth respondents were represented. Second, the observations as to the desirability of a derivative action, where a company could not readily authorise the commencement of the proceedings, do not have the consequence that the company should not be given notice of the application and an opportunity to be heard as to whether the proposed proceedings should be conducted at its cost.Mr Jaworski also refers to the observations of Finkelstein J inWood v Links Golf Tasmania[2010] FCA 570 at [9], which was a statutory derivative action,where his Honour ordered that the company indemnify the plaintiff for its costs. That, however, was an application of the statutory requirements for leave to bring a derivative action in respect of a company under theActand, second, is a rare (and possibly the only) case in which such an order has been made, amidst a multitude of cases in which, to the contrary, a shareholder has been required to indemnify the company for the costs to which it will be exposed by the proceedings in order to obtain suchleave.For these reasons, while Mr Jaworski's account of the cases has been helpful, it does not support the conclusion for which he contends, that this is a simple case that it would be inappropriate to give CAANZ an opportunity to be heard as to whether Mr Jaworski should be permitted to pursue a claim at CAANZ’scost, whether to an intermediate point or in its entirety. It is important, in that respect, thatMr Jaworski does not provide the Court with the assistance of any Counsel’s opinion, as contemplated byWallersteiner,as to the prospects of the claim that he seeks to bring on CAANZ’s behalf and at its cost. Absent such an opinion, the Court’s assessment of that matter would be better informed if CAANZ is allowed an opportunity to be heard and make submissions in that regard.The question inthis application,affidavit evidenceand matter4s raised by Mr JaworskiWith this background, the question which arises in the application is a narrow one, namely whether Mr Jaworski should be required to serve the Summons on CAANZ before any determination of any question as to whether he should be entitled to pursue the proceedings further at CAANZ’s cost.Mr Jaworski reliesonhis affidavit dated 28 June 2024 which is some 194 pages in length part of which is in the nature of submissions. I have, consistent with the usual practice ofJudges in this Court, undertaken a preliminary review of that affidavit before coming on to the bench, and the affidavit has now been read by Mr Jaworski in the course of the hearing this morning. It seems to me that the matters which are in issue do not depend upon a detailed review of the allegations made in that affidavit, at least unless and until CAANZ is allowed an opportunity tobe heard as to those matters, beforethe Courtdetermineswhether Mr Jaworskishould be permitted topursue the proceedings further at its cost.I should, however, note the matters which Mr Jaworski has raised in the course of submissions which are directed to the proposition that the Court should grant the relief he seeks on an ex parte basis, without CAANZ being given any opportunity to be heard as to those matters.First, Mr Jaworski submits that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to require the Summons to be served on CAANZ to allow it an opportunity to respond to the allegations, before determining whether Mr Jaworski can pursuethe proceedings further at its cost. Plainly, that question needs to be determined in the particular circumstances, but it needs to be determined in the context that procedural fairness would ordinarily require that a party against which relief is sought, here to permit proceedings to be conductedon CAANZ’s behalf andat its cost, should be given the opportunity to be heard as to whether that relief should be granted. I recognise that Mr Jaworski points to several matters that he submits are such that procedural fairness is excluded here, and I will address those matters below.Second, Mr Jaworski submits that CAANZ is not incorporated under theActbut under Royal Charter, and that that may limit protections afforded to its shareholders under theActalthough protections will still be available at general law. I assume, without deciding, that that is the case, and that the question whether the orders sought by Mr Jaworski should be made will be determined by general law principles which existed prior to the introduction of the statutory regime for derivative actions under theAct, to which I referred above. That, however, is not sufficient to excludethe desirability ofprocedural fairness, so far as relief is sought against CAANZ, to permit proceedings to be conductedon its behalfat its cost.Third, Mr Jaworski submits that the officers of CAANZ have effective control of it and have acted in a manner that is oppressive and prejudicial to the interests of its members and inconsistently with the purpose of CAANZ of promoting transparency and accountability. It must be recognised that that is an allegation; CAANZ may well not agree with that characterisation of the conduct of its officers; and potentially, the officers themselves may not agree with that characterisation, although they have not been presently joined as party to the proceedings to give them any opportunity to respond to it.Fourth, Mr Jaworski submits that, when the officers of CAANZ are accused of wrongdoing, it is unfair for them to use the resources of CAANZ to respond to that allegation. That proposition plainly depends upon the existence of a basis for the allegation of misconduct and it also depends on the way in which CAANZ responds to the allegations against its officers. For example, it would becommon and desirable practice, where such an allegation is made, for an organisation to appoint an independent board committee comprised of persons against whom the allegation is not made, or adopt some other mechanism of corporate governance,to allow decisions to be made by persons who do not have an interest in the matter. Whether CAANZ would take that course remains to be seen, but it will not have the opportunity to do so unless it is afforded an opportunity to be heard before the relief sought by Mr Jaworski is granted. No doubt, if CAANZ, under the control of the alleged wrongdoers were to expend its resources in their defence, that might be a matter which warranted intervention by the Court. But whether CAANZ will do so is a matter that is yet to emerge and cannot emerge unless it has the opportunity to be heard as to the relief sought.Fifth, Mr Jaworski submits, by reference toWallersteinerto which I referred above, that a company's resources can or should be used to provide legal representation in an action broughtinthe company's name againstits officers. I accept that that is a potential order but it is not an order that should be made in every case or without any inquiry into the merits of the allegations. In particular, it is not apparent that every person who wishes to bring a derivative action against a body other than a corporation, irrespective of the merits of the allegations to be made, should be funded by that body in doing so. Plainly, that proposition requires at least a preliminary inquiry as to the merits of the allegation, and the majority inWallersteinerrecognised that it may be appropriate to allow the body to be heard in respect of that preliminary inquiry, albeit there may be constraints on the manner in which the body makes relevant corporate decisions as to how to respond to the allegations made.Sixth, Mr Jaworski submits that CAANZ should be legally represented but that the process is forcing him to represent CAANZ. I do not accept that submission where the process has, at least in the form that the Summons contemplates, two stages. The first is the application that Mr Jaworski has brought for approval to bring a derivative action with funding to be provided by CAANZ in which he is entitled to represent himself and has done so. The second is astage by which, if Mr Jaworski is allowed such approval, then he (acting on behalf of CAANZ) can be legally represented at its cost.Seventh, Mr Jaworski submits that his affidavit shows a prima facie case against the alleged wrongdoers. However, the difficulty with drawing inferences from that affidavit, without allowing the parties against whom such inferences are to be drawn an opportunity to be heard, is that it is inconsistent with procedural fairness, and this is not a simple case of the kind contemplated as one possibility inWallersteiner. It is a matter of common experience that perceptions may differ, so CAANZ might, for example, consider that there are other matters which are relevant, in explanation of its officers’conduct, in addition to those to which Mr Jaworski has pointed. To reach a conclusion whether as to the strength of the proposed claim without allowing CAANZ an opportunity to be heard, would deprive it of procedural fairness in respect of the application and undermine the reliability of that decision.Eighth, Mr Jaworski points to his intention, by his affidavit, to secure justice for CAANZ in respect of its claims against the alleged wrongdoers. Again, I proceed on the basis that that is Mr Jaworski's intention but not all derivative actions are well-founded, whether under the general law or by statute, and“leave”(in the relevant sense) has been granted both in the United Kingdom and in Australia in some applications and not in others. Again, that contemplates a process to determine whether such leave should be granted, in which procedural fairness is an important component of that process at least in a complex case. Mr Jaworski also submits that his claims raise important public interest matters, but it seems to me that the same issues arise in that respect, namely that that is a question best determinedafterprocedural fairness is allowed to CAANZ,so far as it is affected by an application to bring the proceedingson its behalf andat its cost.Ninth, Mr Jaworski submits that his affidavit presents the whole of the case and his evidence is not contested. He points to the fact that he has available about 500 pages of additional documents, in electronic form, which he would be \"happy to provide to the Court\". No doubt, those documents could be tendered,subject to any proper objection, in a hearing of Mr Jaworski’s application in due course. While Mr Jaworski's affidavit may well provide the whole of the case as he perceives it, that highlights the possibility that CAANZ may consider that other matters are relevant to the relief he seeks, beyond those which he has identified. Second, the proposition that the affidavit is not contested simply reflects the fact that CAANZ has not yet had any opportunity to respond to it, and any contest could only emerge after that opportunity was permitted to it.Tenth, Mr Jaworski identifies several key matters to be dealt with in his proposed claim, including contentions that the alleged wrongdoers have acted to quash members' rights to call the board to account; that they amended the basis on which a resolution could be proposed by members to require 100 rather than 10 members as the minimum number of members to do so; that office bearers have been paid remuneration and, after a challenge to their entitlement to that remuneration, that resolution was put to an annual general meeting for approval; and that CAANZ's accounts do not \"require truth and fairness\", although it was not entirely clear whether this was an allegation that those accounts were not in fact true and fair accounts. I recognise that these allegations are made; I proceed on the basis that, if established, they are likely significant matters; however, the strength of the case, and whether CAANZ should be required to pay the costs of pursuing it, would be best determinedafterCAANZis allowed an opportunity to be heard. I note, for completeness, that Mr Jaworski also referred to a concern that, if CAANZ was joined as the defendant in proceedings brought by him personally, the directors would rely on legal professional privilege, and raised the possibility that such privilege may not be available if the action is brought by CAANZ. That question is best left for determination if and when proceedings are pursued further on CAANZ's behalf.Eleventh, Mr Jaworski referred to a suggested \"Catch-22\", where legal representation is required for CAANZ but he does not have access to such legal representation at this point. There is, it seems to me, no inconsistency so as to constitute a \"Catch-22\" in that respect. As I noted above, the present application may be brought by Mr Jaworski without legal representation,although I have drawn his attention to the desirability of legal representation; if the application succeeds, the proceedings can continue on CAANZ’s behalf and funded by CAANZ, and CAANZ can be legally represented at its cost.Twelfth, Mr Jaworski referred to the decision inOatesin the Court of Appeal, which in turn referred toWallersteiner, as authority that there was no need for \"leave\" to commence a derivative action, although, immediately after the action was commenced,“leave”would be sought on an ex parte basis. Mr Jaworski expanded on that proposition in the further submissions as to the case law to which I referred above. I proceed on that basis,although I recognisedabove that that is arguably not the basis on which the Summons proceeds, so far as it seeks such leave. So far as the question whether a hearing as to“leave”should take place on an ex parte basis, I have noted above that it seems to me that it would be preferable in a matter of this complex character that CAANZ have the opportunity to be heard as to whether it should be ordered to pay the costs of legal representation for Mr Jaworski (acting on its behalf) in the proposed proceedings. There is no inconsistency in that proposition, where the question of how the application is to be heard, whether on an ex parte basis or otherwise, can be determined on notice to the party affected by the application, so it at least has an opportunity to be heard as to that practical matter.Thirteenth, Mr Jaworski submits that he does not have the funds to pay a legal representative and I proceed on that basis. However, Mr Jaworski, as I have noted above, is entitled to be self-represented in this aspect of the application and he is presently self-represented in this aspect of the application. Plainly, the position may differ if, ultimately, CAANZ is ordered to pay his costs of proceedings brought on its behalf.Further, and importantly, I have drawn to Mr Jaworski's attention the fact that there is a significant risk for self-represented litigants, including Mr Jaworski, who lack adequate resources to conduct litigation. While Mr Jaworski's representing himself, at this point, has the consequence that he is not incurring the costs of legal representation, he remains exposed to the costs of legal representation of CAANZ, if he is unsuccessful in respect of this application, at least where it is permitted to be heard in this application.Fourteenth, Mr Jaworski submitted that the Court should read his affidavit in order to reach a conclusion as to these matters. I have noted above that, consistent with the Court's usual practice, I have reviewed that affidavit before coming on to the bench and it seems to me that the detail of that affidavit does not exclude the desirability of the proceedings being served upon CAANZ, so that it canbe heardas to the question whether proceedings should be continued by Mr Jaworski on its behalf at its cost.OrdersI have allowed Mr Jaworski the opportunity to be heard as to orders, and I accept that it would be inappropriate to direct him to serve this application on CAANZ, where he is concerned that the service of the application would expose him to costs then incurred by CAANZ, to which he does not wish to be exposed. In those circumstances, the preferable course is to allow Mr Jaworski the option to serve the proceedings, if he wishes to do so, but stay the proceedings until that has occurred. That allows him to continue the proceedings, if he wishes to do so, but does not require him to do so if he does not wish to do so.Mr Jaworski has also raised the possibility that he will seek leave to reopen, to the extent that I may not have understood the submissions that he has put or that he may wish to address further matters as to the case law, which I have addressed above. Ordinarily, leave to reopen is not readily granted, but I bear in mind that the issues are complex and Mr Jaworski is self-represented. I will make directions which will allow him the opportunity for further submissions and reserve to him the opportunity to apply for leave to reopen, while reserving the question whether such leave should be granted.Accordingly, I make the following orders:1.Note that the proceedings have not been served.2.Stay the proceedings until they are served upon the Defendant, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.3.Direct the Plaintiff, Mr Jaworski, to notify the Associate to Black J within two days of serving the proceedings, to permit their relisting.4.Relist the proceedings in the Corporations Directions List on 16 December 2024, with a view to dismissal of the proceedings for want of prosecution if they have not been served by that date.5.Direct that Mr Jaworski provide an outline of any further submissions that he wishes to make in any application to reopen, limited to ten pages in Arial font 12 in one and a half spacing, to the Associate to Black J by 4pm on 23 August 2024.6.Relist the matter for any application to reopen by Mr Jaworski, and any oral submissions in that regard, in the Corporations Motions List at 9.15am on 26 August 2024.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The relationships between immigrants to Australia from that town have reverberated across the decades to assume importance in these proceedings, including the motion now before the Court. That motion seeks ordersforcertain personstoundergo a parentage testing procedure, more colloquially known as a DNAtest.Without disrespect I shall refer to those involved by their Christian names, in some cases Anglicised. They all trace their origins toCinquefrondi.For the reasons which follow, the Court will grant the relief sought in the motion.Ms T Catanzariti of Counsel appeared for Peter, the applicant on the motion. Ms M Fraser of Counsel appeared for theestateof the late Salvatore Napoli and Mrs M Pringle represented the two other respondents to the motion (to whom I shall refer as theNapoli brothers). I acknowledge the assistance the Court has received from the written submissions of Ms Catanzariti and Mrs Pringle, and the submissions advanced today by allcounsel.Procedural historyBy summons filedon24 April 2004, the plaintiff PeterPronestiseeks provision from the estate. The now 99 year old defendant is Salvatore’s wife, Angela. By reasonofthe infirmities of her advanced age, her son Antonio has been appointed her tutor for these proceedings.Salvatore died in 2003, which means Peter’s proceedings are brought well out of time. Peter says that the reason for the delay is that until September 2023, he believed himself to be the youngest of eight children born to RosaPronestiand her husband, the late GiuseppePronesti. However, it was then that Rosa allegedly told Peter that his real father was Salvatore Napoli.Peter accepts that his claim for a family provision order solely depends upon his being Salvatore’s son. He says he will discontinue these proceedings if he is not. To that end, by motion filed on 8 July 2024, Peter seeks orders that he, together with Antonio (in his personal capacity) and Giuseppe Napoli (both being sons of Salvatore) undergo a parentage testing procedure under Division 6 of theStatus of Children Act 1996(NSW) (the Act).The estate disputes the allegation that Peter is Salvatore’s son. All of the respondents opposed the relief sought in the motion.EvidenceBefore setting out the evidence, I should make a preliminary observation. No party should assume that evidence Ihaveadmitted on an interlocutory basis would be admissibleat a final hearingin the form in which Ihavereceived ittoday. Some of that evidence related to whatareobviouslysensitive and difficult matters for the families concerned.Quite properly, no party sought to cross-examine the others’witnesses.As I indicated during the course of argument, the importance of that evidence today was to establish that there is a dispute in these proceedings about Peter’s parentage.In acceding to Peter’s motion, the Court makes no findings as to the truth or otherwise of therespectiveallegations which demonstrate the existence of that dispute.The evidence included affidavits filed byPeter, and byGiuseppe Napoli. Antonio Napoli did not file an affidavit. I observe at the outset that there was no evidence in which either of the Napoli brothers said in terms that they personally objected to undergoing a test. Insofar as their counsel resisted the motion, there was certainly no evidence from either of the Napoli brothers(to the extent the Court might infer their objection)or submission put on their behalf, of any reason why they might personally object to the test. Nor was there any evidence that the Napoli brothers would not obey the order (although I acknowledge thats 29 of the Actprovidesthat they can do so without penalty, with the Court then able to“draw such inferences as appear just in the circumstances”).There were also two matters of common ground:That by reference to applicable common law and statutory presumptions, Peter was the son of Rosa andthe lateGiuseppePronesti;That the test proposed in the motion (being by reference to the Y chromosome) could not definitively establish that Salvatore was Peter’s father. The most it could do was establish, if positive, that Peter,Antonioand Giuseppe shared a common paternal line, but not distinguishing brothers from paternal cousins and the like. However,a negative result woulddemonstrate that they did not share a common paternal line, which would necessarily exclude Salvatore as Peter’s father (there being no evidence to suggest that Antonio and Giuseppe Napoli were anything other than Salvatore’s sons).Peter’s evidence established three things:Peter says that in September 2023, Rosa–in the presence of a witness who has provided confirmatory instructions to Peter’s solicitor–told Peter that Salvatore was his birth father, whereas until then Peter had always believed GiuseppePronestiwas his birth father. To Peter’s observation at the time of her alleged disclosure, Rosa had“some dementia”and has now lost capacityto give evidence.Peter has since undertaken a DNA test with the person he believed to be hisbrother of thefullbloodSalvatore (Sam)Pronesti. The result of that testexcludes them havingashared patrilineal heritage.That is to say, itdemonstrates that GiuseppePronestiwas not Peter’s birth father (therebeing no evidence to suggest that Sam was anything other than GiuseppePronesti’sson).Peter says that after he had received the results of the test referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph, he had spoken to Giuseppe Napoli, who had said that he (Giuseppe) was 99.9% sure Salvatore was Peter’s birth father.Giuseppe Napoli’s affidavit was directed to the suggestion that there were two other men who could have been Peter’s birth father, including one who was not fromCinquefrondi.The affidavit read onbehalfof the estate included some solemn documents signed by Rosa in the 1990s which were said to demonstratethat sheacknowledgedhereightchildren, including Peter, as hers and GiuseppePronesti’s.SubmissionsMs Catanzariti submitted that Peter’s evidence demonstrated that there was a proper basis to contend Salvatore wasPeter’sbirth father and that, given the estate’s refusal to acknowledge Peter as Salvatore’s son, there was obviously a dispute in the proceedings about Peter’s parentage. She contended there was real utility at this early stage ofthe proceedings to orderthe test, because the proceedings would immediately come to an end if the results showed no patrilineal connection between Peter and the Napoli brothers. Ms Catanzariti also relied on the fact that the Napoli brothers had raised no personal objection to undergoing the test, whether medical,religiousor otherwise (being objections which the Court would have been boundto consider and determine under s 27(4) of the Act).The essence of Mrs Pringle’s thorough submissions was, to quote herwrittenoutline,that Peter’s motion should failbecause the orders sought were“unlikely to either advance or clarify the question of the plaintiff’s true paternity”. However, when I put to her that there had to be some realutilityif the test could disprove Peter’s contentionthat Salvatore was his birth father, Mrs Pringle did not press her clients’objection further.Ms Fraser pressed the estate's objection on what,without disrespect,can be distilled to two grounds as I understood them.First, it was for Peter to make out his entitlement to a family provision order, and the test would not determine whether he was Salvatore's son. She also placed emphasis on the fact that even by Peter's own admission, Rosa was suffering from dementia and had now lost capacity, such that her evidence could be given little weight, assuming it was received in an admissible form at a final hearing.This was said to demonstratetheweakness ofPeter'sargument today that thereevenwas a seriously arguableissueabout his parentage. Second, Ms Fraser submitted that requiring tests for patrilineality might encourage othersto come forward as potential claimants.ConsiderationThe Court accepts MsCatanzariti’ssubmissions set out in[15]above. In doing so, I respectfully adopt the characteristicallyand helpfullycompendiousexposition of therelevantauthorities set out byHallenJ inKohariv NSW Trustee and Guardian[2016] NSWSC 1372at [40]–[51].The jurisdictional prerequisite for ordering a parentage testing procedure under s 26 of the Act is that these are“proceedings where the parentage of a child is in issue”. Thatis satisfied by reference to the evidence I have set out above. In the absence of any objection by the Napoli brothersto undergoing the test, and even allowing for the possibility that they can refuse to comply with the order, the Court finds there is real utility in ordering them to undertake the test because a negative result will bring these proceedings to an early end, saving everyone time,troubleand costs.I do not accept Ms Fraser's submissionsset out in [18] above.Her first submission ignores the possibility of the test producing a negative outcome. Nor do I accept her reliance on Rosa's apparent mental condition at the time sheallegedlymade her disclosure to Peter as being relevant for today’s hearing.Howeverthat disclosure might be treated at a final hearing,the evidence–when taken with the other matters referred to in [12] above - is of sufficient weight on an interlocutory basis to warrant the making of the orders sought.I reject her second submission because there is no basis in the evidence orevenby speculation to think that the outcome to which she referred is likely, especially when it is understood that the test cannot prove specific paternity. It seems to methat identifying a class of persons with nothing more than a patrilineal connection is unlikely to incite furtherclaims.CostsPeter's motion sought a costs orderonlyagainst the estate. No costs were sought against the Napoli brothers, and they made no application for their costs.Insofar as the estate is concerned, Ms Catanzariti submitted that the estate had opposed the motion and that costs should follow the event. TheCourt has determined, she submitted, a discrete issuewhich willnever be revisited. The estate hadmore than adequate opportunity to agree to the tests being undertakenbefore the motion was filed. It couldalsohave submittedto the outcome of the motion once it had been filed,and left the Napoli brothersto be the active contradictors.Ms Fraser,on behalf of the estate,submitted that costs should be reserved. She said this was a case where the costs outcome should abide what ultimately happens in the final result.It wasfor Peterto prove hisstatus as a person eligible to seek a family provision order, anddeterminingthe costs of the present application shouldawaitwhether or not he was able to do so. She further submitted that there was a duty on the part of her client to protect the estate which warranted opposition to the motion.The court accepts MsCatanzariti'ssubmissionsset out in [25] above.AstoMs Fraser's submission concerning protection ofthe estate, I respectfully disagree that theduty required ongoing opposition to the present motion.Thatsubmissionoverlooks both the duty to protect the estate by avoiding unnecessary costs,and the requirement upon the estate as a litigant under s 56(3)of theCivil Procedure Act2005(NSW)toassist the Court to furtherthe achievement of the overriding purpose.

Previously, the older brother, George, had married in 1982, but that marriage did not last, and in around September 1983, George returned to the family home at Fenwick Street. From the period from around 1986 to 1992, George and his parents lived together at Fenwick Street.For some five months in early 1992, while his parents went to Greece, George lived at Fenwick Street by himself.

Inaround 2007, following financial difficulties, Con and his family returned to Fenwick Street. Indeed, Con and his family experienced financial difficulties to the extent that he declared bankruptcy in July 2006. By then he had sold the Edward Street property and bought a property in Kangaroo Point, but that too was soldin about October 2007. The bankruptcy is significant, I interpolate, because of the changes to Con’s parents’wills at around about this time. Thereafter, Con’s son Theo continued to live at Fenwick Street until 2015 whenhe moved out upon his marriage. Prior to 2015, George had been living at least intermittently in the house and sleeping on a couch. After 2015, George moved into Theo’s bedroom.

The plaintiff's solicitors responded within a week advising that steps hadbeen taken to commence the sale of the property, and that proceedings had been commenced in this Court.Sofar as the evidence discloses there is no immediate threat that the plaintiff will be evicted for non-payment of the fees.

The tutor is the plaintiff’s granddaughter and the daughter of the younger son, Mr ConBosganas. The two sons were born in 1960 and 1965 respectively. They are aged approximately 64 and 59. Without any disrespect or unwarranted familiarity I shall follow the course adopted during the hearing and refer to members of theBosganasfamily by their given names.The proceedings were set down for final hearing on 26 June 2024 by Davies J sitting in the Possession List. On that occasion, Mr Horowitz appeared for the plaintiff, as he has appeared today, and an appearance was recorded for the defendant by a solicitor, Mr Steve Kassem. There has been no appearance on behalf of the defendant before me today. On 16 July 2024, an affidavit of George sworn on that date was filed, electronically, at 12.59pm. The solicitor filing the affidavit on its face appears to be Mr Kassem. Mr Kassem by email sent to the plaintiff’s solicitors at 1.47pm on 16 July attached, in draft, the cross claim, affidavit of his client and exhibits to that affidavit.I have mentioned those dates because there has been no appearance by the defendant today. A series of documents have been tendered before me. The first (exhibit A) records under the heading,“Register of Disciplinary Action”, that apparently on 30 April 2024 the Law Society refused to issue a practising certificate for the year ended 30 June 2024 to Mr Kassem. I note, incidentally, that although the email correspondence refers to“Steve Kassem”, both his namein the form it appears on the covering page of George’s affidavit and on the register of disciplinaryaction is“Ammar Steve Kassem”. There is nothing to suggest that it is not one and the same individual. Mr Kassem was the sole director and shareholder ofFutureLegalPty Ltd(exhibit B). That company was the subject of a winding up order made by the Federal Court of Australia on7 February2024(exhibit C). Further, a search today of the register of solicitors maintained by the Law Society of New South Wales records that Mr Kassem isno longer registered as a solicitor(exhibit F;there are two other individuals named Kassem, but they have different given names and operate out of different practices).The reason for this recitation is twofold. The first is that I accept Mr Horowitz’s submission that I should be satisfied that George has personal knowledge on his own part (as opposed merely to the imputed knowledge of his solicitor) of the fact that the hearing of these proceedings was set down for a final basis today. That inference is drawn from the fact that George has prepared an affidavit on 16 July with the assistance of his solicitor(by whom it was witnessed)which is intended to refute the plaintiff’s application for possession as well as to substantiate the matters put forward in hiscross-claim.Secondly, although I am acutely conscious that Mr Kassem has not been heard and I make no findings in relation to what has occurred since 30 April 2024, there is at least a strong prospect that George, the client, has not been well served by what appears to be(basedon the materials in the court book)the second solicitor he has sought to retain to defend these proceedings.That in turnhas direct consequences for such relief as the plaintiff is entitled.I am confident that Mr Horowitz, very properly, has sought to engage not only with the high points of his case and the low points put forward by the defendant, but also the high points of the defendant’s case both in opposition to the relief he seeks and in support of the relief that was sought pursuant to across-claim.A further peculiarity of this litigation is that although when the matter was set down on 26 June 2024, and more particularly when the matter returned before Davies J on 16 July 2024, the defendant was given leave to file a crossclaim,nocrossclaim has ever been filed. The email to which I referred, exhibitE, senton 16 July at 1.47pm, has Mr Kassem saying,“In the last few hours Ihavetried to file theCrossClaim and waited on the phone to no avail. I apologise for this delay as it may be thecaseIwillneed to arrange for theCrossClaim to be filed in person with theRegistry.\"Very properly, the plaintiff in seeking as she has today judgment for possession of the land, has addressed the reasons why both equitable responses in the draftcross-claim, which are sought to be supported by George’s affidavit, should not be made out. Those matters may be summarised as being a claim for a common intention constructive trust and a claim for an estoppel based on a conversation with George and Con's parents said to have taken place in 1984 or 1985.A brief background of the family history which is sufficient for present purposes is as follows.There are two pieces of land in Bankstown to which I shall refer as Fenwick Street and Edward Street. Edward Street was transferred by Con’s and George’s parents in 1984 (CB144). That was at about the time of the conversation,and alsoat around the time that Con married and left the family home at Fenwick Street. Previously, the older brother, George, had married in 1982, but that marriage did not last, and in around September 1983, George returned to the family home at Fenwick Street. From the period from around 1986 to 1992, George and his parents lived together at Fenwick Street.For some five months in early 1992, while his parents went to Greece, George lived at Fenwick Street by himself. But on their return, George left that home following his father’s request.In 1996, 1997, and part of 1998, while building a new house at Edward Street, Con, his wife, and two children (Theo and Lena) returned and lived in the family home at Fenwick Street. George was not living there at that time. Sometime in 1998,Conand his family moved to their Edward Street home. Inaround 2007, following financial difficulties, Con and his family returned to Fenwick Street. Indeed, Con and his family experienced financial difficulties to the extent that he declared bankruptcy in July 2006. By then he had sold the Edward Street property and bought a property in Kangaroo Point, but that too was soldin about October 2007. The bankruptcy is significant, I interpolate, because of the changes to Con’s parents’wills at around about this time. Thereafter, Con’s son Theo continued to live at Fenwick Street until 2015 whenhe moved out upon his marriage. Prior to 2015, George had been living at least intermittently in the house and sleeping on a couch. After 2015, George moved into Theo’s bedroom. Con’s daughter Lena moved out in September 2019 when she was married.By that time, Con’s and George’s father had passed away, on 11 March 2019, andfairly shortlythereafter their motherLenawas moved to where she currently resides atGillawarnaVillage which is operated by Bankstown City Aged Care. Sadly, she suffers from dementia. There is a dispute on the material before me as to when that dementia took away her capacity, but it is accepted as I understand the material that she no longer has testamentary capacity.The plaintiff, Lena, seeks possession of the Fenwick Street property. She is its registered proprietor. She is in the receipt of an aged pension, and the evidence before me establishes that while that pension is sufficient to meet the daily expenses of the nursing home (they are $61.96 per day), it falls short of meeting her other needs, both at the home and more particularly by way of medicine, and it falls short of meeting the outgoings for Fenwick Street.The evidence before me establishes that the operators ofGillawarnaVillage have advised (on 2 April 2024) that the total amount in arrears owed by the plaintiff at that stage was $7,689.92. That email advised that the debt required immediate attention. The plaintiff's solicitors responded within a week advising that steps hadbeen taken to commence the sale of the property, and that proceedings had been commenced in this Court.Sofar as the evidence discloses there is no immediate threat that the plaintiff will be evicted for non-payment of the fees. There was also evidence that rates on the property have remained unpaid.On 25 January 2024, the plaintiff’s solicitors served a“Notice to Vacate”upon George. The notice states that the plaintiff’s pension had been reduced in December 2023 based on the value of her assets. I interpolate to note that that appears to have been the case, but more recently the pension received by her has increased so that it is just sufficient to pay daily expenses. The letter proceeds to advise that the plaintiff was unable to meet her monthly accommodation fees, that they were in arrears, and that funds were urgentlyrequired to meet both accommodation costs and other expenses. The letter advised that the property was proposed to be sold and that“despite being requested to vacate theProperty on numerous occasions you[George]haverefused to do so”. Notice was given to vacate the property and remove all belongings by 5pm on 15 February 2024, and the letter continued“To avoid doubt, any consent you previously may have had to occupy theProperty is withdrawn”.The response from the first set of solicitors retained by the defendant was to refer to a recent dispute between the two brothers. I note that there is no dispute that last December there was a dispute between the two brothers which resulted in the two men (aged in their late 50s or early or mid-60s)coming to blowsand alsothat George“does not accept the validity of thePower ofAttorney and disputes its validity, legitimacy and authenticity”. I should have said that the notice to vacate stated that the firm was instructed by Mr ConBosganas, the younger son.It is convenient to deal with this point immediately.On 24 January 2019, the plaintiff executed two documents: an enduring power of attorney in favour of Con, with hiswifeElizabeth being a substitute attorney, anda second documentappointing Con as the enduring guardian and hiswifeElizabeth as an alternative guardian.The significance of both of those documents is that they were each prepared in the presence of a solicitor, Mr David Bentley, who signed a certificate for each. The certificate for the enduring power of attorney states that Mr Bentley explained its effect and that Lena“appeared to understand the effect of this power of attorney”. The certificate for the enduring guardian states“LenaBosganasappeared to understand the effect of this instrument and executed the instrument voluntarily in my presence.”There is no reason to doubt that if Mr Bentley were under any misapprehension as to Lena’s capacity to execute either document, he would not have signed the certificate. Further, although in correspondence the solicitors formerly acting for George disputed the efficacy of the power of attorney, the affidavit prepared by him responding to the statement of claim does not provide anybasis to sustain the proposition that Lena lacked capacity when executing either of those documents.For those reasons, I am satisfied that (a) Lena, the granddaughter,acting as the plaintiff's tutor, and(b)Con, the son, acting as donee of power of attorney and enduring guardian, are both authorised to bring these proceedings.I reject the submission in correspondence to the contrary.The substantial aspects of this dispute would have arisen on the unfiledcross-claim. The circumstances that it has not been filed are unexplained, and perhaps have to do with the cancellation of Mr Kassem’s practising certificate. Nonetheless, I have been taken through the material which had been served by Mr Kassem in support of thatcross-claimwhich, if it had been made out, would be a complete answer to the relief now sought.There is a large dispute between the brothers as to whether the conversation in 1984 and 1985, whereby their father stated that the Fenwick Street property would be the oldest son George’s occurred, or anything like it occurred. But there are also other, and indeed numerous–as is not atypical in cases such as this–disputes between the brothers as to the history within their family, both as to the care given by them to their parents, and what was said in relation to the property. But Mr Horowitz has emphasised that it is not necessary to resolve those factual issues because both aspects of the claims which George sought to advance are not made out, even taking his evidence at its highest.As I have previously indicated, George spent some time intermittently in residence in the property with his parents. Over the last three decades, to the extent that he has been in residence, so too have been his brother and family. There is no suggestion that George at any time paid rent when he was there. There is evidence in the form of Con’s affidavit of George falling out with his fatherthrough the use ofillicit drugs and indeed thedispute,as I understand it,which led to a physical altercation last December between the two brothers was connected with ensuring that a gate in the backyard was kept closed which is not unrelated to the use of illicit drugs.Insofar as equity will recognise a constructive trust based upon a representation, it is necessary to establish significant detrimental reliance. Non-pecuniary reliance may, especially in a family context,suffice:seethe reference to“life-changing decisions with irreversible consequences of a profoundly personal nature”inSidhu v Van Dyke(2014) 251 CLR 505; [2014] HCA 19 at [84]. But in the present case there is very little in George’s affidavit to suggest any material form of detrimental reliance upon the conversation that was said to have occurred in 1984 or 1985. Conspicuous by its absence is any suggestion that George abandoned other–brighter–opportunitiesand stayed in the premises on the strength of the promise.Insteadthe position seems to be that he at times intermittently stayed rent free in the family home. Therearesuggestionsin George's affidavitat paragraphs 23 and 58that George cared for his aging parents. Even that evidence is relatively elliptically expressed.ThusGeorge says,“As my parents became older, my care for them and time spent assisting them increased”, and,“I have committed my life to my parents and I have lived in the Fenwick property since the day I was born.”Against any inference that might be drawn from those or other more general propositions, Con gives evidence, principally by reference to appointments taken from his mobile phone, of numerous medical consultations that he says overwhelmingly he and he alone took his parents to. But even taking George's evidence at itshighest, andaccepting as I do that there were periods of time when George looked after his parents, there is nothing like the sort of detrimental reliance–for example as may be described as“life-changing decisions”–as could give rise to the response of the equitable remedy of a constructive trust of the land.George also puts forward the proposition that there should be a common intention constructive trust of the land in his favour. The availability in Australia of such a doctrine is itself not free from controversy:seeBijkerkInvestments Pty Ltd vBikic[2020] NSWSC 1336 at [111]-[120] andGalati v Deans[2023] NSWCA 13 at [53]-[59].Another aspect which appears to be controversial is the content of the requirement of detrimental reliance: seeBijkerkInvestments Pty Ltd vBikicat [123]-[124].It entirely unnecessary to address any aspect ofthose issues. The substantial difficulty confronting acceptance of a common intention constructive trust in the present case arises from the inferences to be drawn by the series of wills executed by George’sand Con’s parents starting from 1991.It will be borne in mind that if, as George contends, there was a common intention that Edward Street having been transferred to Con during his lifetime at the time of his marriage, and George as the older son was to receive the family home, then a willwould have beennecessary to effectuate that intention. It is true that both mother and father executed many wills. However,none of them effectuated the intention which George gives evidence of.By willexecutedon 9 September 1991, Con's and George’s father, Theo, left his property first to his wife and if she predeceased then to both of their sons in equal shares. By subsequent will executed on 30 April 2009, substantially the same result waseffected. A different approach was taken in the next will dated 12 January 2015. That willappointedhis wife as sole executrix and trustee and left the entirety of his estate to her but in the event that she predeceased, appointed George as executor and then divided the estate three ways between George and Con's children, Theo and Lena. Relatively shortly thereafter, by willexecutedon 4 June 2015, Theo made the same dispositions but with the difference that in the event that his wife predeceased he appointed Con rather than George as sole executor and trustee. Finally, by willexecutedon 7 July 2016 which on the evidence before me is his last will and testament, the will reverted to the earlier pattern, namely, leaving the entire estate to his wife but in the event that she predeceased dividing it in equal shares between the two sons Con and George. Con’s evidence before me–and it is supported by the fact of his bankruptcy in 2006–is that he was involved in litigationin late 2014 and 2015and against the possibility that he be made bankruptonce again, he advised his father to take steps to exclude him from an inheritancein the event thathis father died.As it turns out, Con’s and George’s father Theo predeceased the plaintiff. I also have before me her wills made in 2009, 2015 (twice) and 2016. They followprecisely the same pattern as the wills of her husband, leaving her estate to her husband, butin the event thathe predeceases:first, in 2009,to the sons in equalshares;secondly, in2015, excluding Con,and dividing the estate in three shares between George and grandchildren Theo and Lena; andthirdly in 2016, which is the last will, in equal shares to Con and George in the event which has transpired, that her husband has predeceased.The upshot is that on every one of those eight or nine occasions when if there were the common intention constructive trust for which George contended, it would have been necessary and appropriate for the substantial asset in the estate, namely Fenwick Street, to be devised to George, at no stage has George been given the entirety of thatproperty. Instead, andconsistentlyover a period of 25 years (in the case of his father Theo) and 7 years (in the case of his mother the plaintiff) Georgehas been given merely a fraction ofthe Fenwick Street property.I rejectthecontention that the application by the registered proprietor for possession of her land is defeated by a common intention constructive trust arising in the circumstances set out in the defendant’s affidavit.Further to the above, the plaintiff makes the point that there has been very substantial delay. On the evidence before me, the first time that a common intention constructive trust was asserted was in response to the proceedings commenced in this Court. There had been a series of fallings out between the brothers beforehand. More importantly, years have passed during which Theo has passed away and Lena, the mother, the plaintiff, has lost capacity, and hence there is very substantial forensic disadvantage in seeking to refute what George now wishes to advance, based upon conversations said to have taken place some 40 years ago.It is not necessary tobase this decision on laches.

That day was intended to be today, but perhaps through reasons outside his control, that has not occurred.For thatreasonI indicated during argument that I was not minded to grant leave which is sought to the plaintiff to issue a writ for possession over the property forthwith. For the same reason I also rejected (or more precisely, resisted the tender until it was withdrawn) theplaintiff’sreliance upon material which had not been shown to have been served.However, I am mindedto acceptthe plaintiff’s primary case, which is an entitlement to judgment for possession, and shortly I will make orders in terms of paragraph1 of the statement of claim that was listed for final hearing today.As noted above, the defendant is entitled, if so minded, to approach the Court to set aside the orders that have been made adverse to him and in his absence:Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)r 36.16(2)(b). The plaintiff is also entitled to have the benefit of legal advice from a lawyer who has a current practising certificate. Those considerations have led to a position which, as I understand it, following an exchange between myself and Mr Horowitz, is not opposed by the plaintiff, namely,that the appropriate course is for the plaintiffto be directed to effect personal service on the defendant of the entirety of the materials relied upon in this application, together with the orders of this Court and the reasons for judgment.Although that is burdensome and perhaps a little unusual, the reality of these unusual circumstances is that the defendant is entitled to obtain legal advice on his entitlements, and in order to obtain that advice in a timely and cost efficient way, the best way of achieving that is in effect for the plaintiff to providewhat in effect isa brief to whomever the defendant may seek to get that advice from.In the meantime, I have expressed the view that it would be inappropriate for the plaintiff to take any steps by way of execution–whether by serving a writ on the property, issuing a writ of possession or serving a bankruptcy notice–until the Court is satisfied that the defendant has been made aware of the orders and the basis on which they are made, and of his entitlement should he see so fit of approaching the Court to be let back into the litigation.For those reasons I make the following orders: Mr Horowitz, these orders will be enteredtodayand we will give you a copy of them when they are entered onJusticeLink, and please feel free to interrupt me and tell me I have the orders slightly wrong.HOROWITZ: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: Order 1 will be in terms of para 1 of the statement of claim. Judgment for the plaintiff, LenaBosganas, for possession of the land comprised in folio identifier XX/XXXX, being the land situated at and known asXXFenwick Street, Bankstown, New South Wales. 2. Direct the plaintiff to effect personal service upon the defendant of (a) these orders, (b) the reasons for judgment of the Supreme Court and (c) the materials upon which the plaintiff relied in that Court, as soon as practicable.I am just interrupting myself. There have been problems of service in the past. I think it is inappropriate to give youa period of time, but the sooner you do it the better, because I am about to make an order which is 28 days from service.HOROWITZ: Yes, thank you.HIS HONOUR: 3. Stay the execution of the judgment inOrder1 above until further order. 4. Grant leave to the plaintiff, no earlier than 28 days after the date upon which personal service has beeneffectedpursuant toOrder2above, to apply to the Court to set aside the stay and take steps to execute the judgment.Mr Horowitz, I have not mentioned this, I am inclined to think because you’ve hinted at and I’ve hinted at, the circumstances of Mr Kassem, that I should direct you to simply serve in the usual way Mr Kassem the same documents. I can see what is going to happen. There is a possibility that the defendant is going to say Mr Kassembehaved badlyand forthat reasonhe should be let backin tothe litigation. The sooner Mr Kassem finds out about this, the better as well.HOROWITZ: Yes.HIS HONOUR: You have not been heard onthis. I am just thinking of directing you to electronically serve,when they are ready, the same materials that you are going to personally serve upon the defendant.HOROWITZ: I concur with that approach. I was just thinking, and I don’t know the answer, just as a matter of public protection, if what I have relied on is true, that there was a solicitor or a legal practitioner practising without a practising certificate, there is a risk to the public should Mr Kassem continue to purport to be a practising solicitor. Might there be a step taken or direction by the Court in relation to notification ofthe matter being directed to The Law Society in relation to this matter?HIS HONOUR: It is for them to take any such step, but you’re quite right, I will make that direction. 5.Directthat the plaintiffserveelectronically by the last address notified, the documents referred to inOrder2 above upon Mr Steve Kassem at the same time as personal service is being effected. 6. Direct the plaintiff to supply a copy of these reasons to the Law Society of New South Wales. 7. The defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of these proceedings to date.[Application for indemnity costs]HIS HONOUR: Application is made by the plaintiff for an order for indemnity costs essentially on the basis that thecross-claimwas never filed, and had it been relied upon, it was destined to fail. I am disinclined to make any such order. It is far from self-evident that the deficiency in the filing of the cross claim is attributable to the defendant as opposed to his solicitor and in those circumstances nothing more need be said as to the inappropriateness of visiting upon the client an order for indemnity costs as is sought.[Discussion re third party costs orders]HIS HONOUR: The transcript will then make it clear that nothing that’s happened to date should stand in the way of any application for athird partycosts order should the plaintiff be so minded.**********Amendments20 August 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t- anonymised folio identifier in orders and [39]DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

On the evidence, it is not even known if some of the other property is lawfully available to the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants."}, {"p_num": 28, "text": "Secondly, the mere existence of alternative assets does not disentitle NAB from exercising its private rights in relation to the Bellevue Hill property if that is what NAB wants to do."}, {"p_num": 29, "text": "Thirdly, there is nothing in theProceeds of Crime Actwhich gives the Court power to modify, restrict or diminish NAB’s private rights as against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants.

Even if the Court were to make such an order in this case, it would not be enough for the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants’purpose. There is nothing in s24(1)(d) which empowers the Court to go further and compel a lender to accept funds from a particular source.

As for the text, s39 empowers the Court to make an“ancillary”order. The ordinary meaning of“ancillary”is to be“subordinate, subsidiary. Later also in weakened sense: supplementary, additional; accompanying”:Oxford English Dictionary,online ed, accessed 15 August 2024.Within s39,“ancillary”evidently means ancillary to a restraining order which the Court has already made (or could have made):Kanjo’s Caseat [50]–[51]."}, {"p_num": 33, "text": "The Court’s power is limited to making orders which the Court“considers appropriate”. Appropriateness is not some unconstrained notion of right, proper or fair. In the first instance appropriateness must be informed by the objects of theProceeds of Crime Act. The principal objects are set out in s5 in the following terms:"}, {"p_num": 34, "text": "The objects were summarised inCommissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Hart(2018)262 CLR 76;[2018] HCA 1at [32]-[33], where Gordan J said:"}, {"p_num": 35, "text": "Section39 empowers the Court to make an order which it considers appropriate having regard to these purposes.

Nine examples of orders which the Court may make are set out in the sub-paragraphs of s39. The examples are not exhaustive. All of the examples relate to the efficacy of the restraining orders, the efficacy of the Official Trustee’s custody and control of the property and the information gathering work of the proceeds of crime authority"}, {"p_num": 37, "text": "In the circumstances of this case, s39 does not empower the Court to make any order which has as its object the restraint on the exercise of NAB’s private rights against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants. Such an order will not serve any of the objects of the statute. It could not be considered appropriate to support the restraining orders which have been made over the Bellevue Hill property, nor the restraining orders which have been made over any of the other property referred to in the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion. Such orders would not conform to or resemble any of the sample orders set out in s39."}, {"p_num": 38, "text": "As a further matter as they concern NAB the purpose of the orders proposed by the fourteenthdefendant is to compel NAB to give up its interests in the BellevueHill property. Given that Division 3 of Part 2-1 of theProceeds of Crime Actspecifically contemplates that interests such as that which NAB has in the Bellevue Hill property ought not to be disrupted by restraining orders, thearrangement which the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants seek to implement would be inconsistent with the statutory regime. That is, unless NAB agrees."}, {"p_num": 39, "text": "I have also had regard to the fact that the orders merely exclude NAB’s interest from the restraining orders which apply to the Bellevue Hill property, and permit NAB to exercise its rights as mortgagee in conformity with the restraining orders. The orders do not enforce any of NAB’s private rights against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants. NAB does not seek a judgment for the debt or an order for possession or a writ for possession. Such matters are not before the Court. If there be a proper basis for it, the fourteenth or fifteenth defendants may resist an application for such orders when NAB makes it. That application will be the appropriate occasion to canvas any issue arising from the private rights and obligations asserted by NAB."}, {"p_num": 40, "text": "For these reasons, I accepted NAB’s application on 12 August 2024. I also dismissed the fourteenth defendant’s application for a stay."}, {"p_num": 41, "text": "The balance of the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion (prayers 2, 3 and 4) seeks orders under ss24(1)(d) and 39(1) to facilitate an alternative arrangement for the repayment of the debt to NAB. The fourteenth defendant submitted that, even after NAB’s interest is excluded from the restraining orders, there is still utility in those prayers being heard and determined by the Court at a future date."}, {"p_num": 42, "text": "Whether or not that is correct depends on whether the Court’s powers under s24(1)(d) and/or whether s39(1) would permit the Court to compel the plaintiff (as opposed to NAB) to accommodate an alternative arrangement which (on this hypothesis) is acceptable to NAB. NAB does not consent to the arrangement currently proposed so the issue is hypothetical. However, it may be presumed that the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants wish to continue negotiations. On the evidence currently before the Court, it cannot be said that there is no prospect of agreement and hence no utility in the balance of the motion being heard at a later date."}, {"p_num": 43, "text": "In those circumstances, I made orders for the balance of the fourteenthdefendant’s motion to be prepared for hearing on 22November2024."}, {"p_num": 44, "text": "In relation to the Notice of Motion filed by NAB on 27 May 2024, the following orders were made on 12 August 2024:"}, {"p_num": 45, "text": "In relation to the Notice of Motion filed by the fourteenth defendant on 9August2024, the following orders were made on 12 August 2024:"}], "full_text": "JUDGMENTAmongst the numerous applications before the Court on 12August2024 was an application by an interested party, namely the National Australia Bank. The application concerns a residential property at Bellevue Hill of which the fourteenthandfifteenthdefendants are registered proprietors. It is their home where the fifteenthdefendant lives with their eight“children”. The fourteenthdefendant also lived there until he went into custody on 1February2023.On the application of the plaintiff, on 31 January 2023 the Court made restraining orders under ss 18(2)(a), 18(2)(b) and 19 of theProceeds of Crime Act 2002(Cth) in relation to the property. NAB is the first registered mortgagee of the property. It did not have notice of the application for restraining orders and did not appear before the Court on 31 January 2023. NAB’s mortgage secures a home loan made by NAB to the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants in 2021, at which time the principal advanced was approximately $9.2 million.There is no dispute that the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants are now in default under the mortgage. On 22 August 2023 NAB issued a default notice demanding payment of the amount then due, just over $9 million. Since then, the amount due has increased. In May 2024 it was approximately $9.5 million. It may be inferred that the amount has increased further since then.NAB wants to be repaid. It wishes to enforce the security, including exercising its rights under the mortgage to enter into possession of the property.On 27 May 2024 NAB filed a Notice of Motion in these proceedings pursuant to which it sought:an order under ss 29 and 30 of theProceeds of Crime Actthat the interest of NAB in the property be excluded from the restraining orders made on 31 January 2023; andother orders which permit NAB to exercise its rights as mortgagee in conformity with the continuing restraining orders which remain over any other interests in the property (prayer 2 and 3).In support of the application NAB relied upon an Affidavit of its solicitor which was affirmed on 24 May 2024, and the documentation exhibited to that Affidavit. The Affidavit largely addresses the matters set out in the preceding paragraphs.Apart from the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants, there is no objection to the orders sought by NAB. In particular, the plaintiff, who obtained the restraining orders in the first place, does not object to NAB’s interest now being excluded.The fourteenth and fifteenth defendants oppose the orders sought by NAB. On 9August2024 the fourteenth defendant filed his own Notice of Motion together with an Affidavit by his solicitor. By his Notice of Motion, the fourteenthdefendant sought:an order that NAB’s Notice of Motion be temporarily stayed (prayer 1); andorders that other property which is currently the subject of other restraining orders be realised and the debt to NAB repaid from the proceeds.The other property which is referred to in the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion includes real property at Richmond, Tarlo and other places. There are also some bank accounts in the names of various individuals and corporations.Apart from the stay in prayer 1, the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion does not explicitly address NAB’s rights as mortgagee. An essential element of the arrangement contemplated by the fourteenth defendant is that NAB will be precluded from exercising its rights under the mortgage and instead be obliged to look to other assets to ensure repayment of the debt. In the absenceof NAB’s agreement (which is not forthcoming), the fourteenth defendant seeks to have the alternative arrangement imposed upon NAB by order of the Court.At a procedural level the fourteenth defendant has proposed that NAB’s motion be adjourned to a date in November 2024 and that a timetable be set to prepare the fourteenth defendant’s motion for simultaneous hearing on that date.The Affidavit by the fourteenth defendant’s solicitor explains how the solicitor was instructed in the case in mid-May 2024. He has had difficulty getting instructions because of the unavailability of documents and because of poor communication with the fourteenth defendant who is a non-English-speaking person currently in custody and heavily distracted by other legal matters, including criminal proceedings. There have also been difficulties in retaining counsel.The fourteenth defendant’s solicitor also gives some evidence about the alternative property which might be used to repay NAB’s debt instead of the Bellevue Hill property. The real properties at Richmond and Tarlo are said to be“substantial rural properties”available for sale to“reduce”the NAB debt. There is no evidence about the other real properties. As for the bank accounts, the amount of money in the accounts is not specified. The solicitor is informed, but does not express any belief, that there is more than $4.5 million being held in trust for“ACIF Prosperity Fund”. There is no evidence about the availability of that money for use by the fourteenth and/or fifteenth defendants. The plaintiff points out some of this property is held in the name of various corporations and it is not clear the basis upon which the fourteenth and/or fifteenth defendants would be entitled to use the property for their own benefit.In light of this evidence, NAB’s apparent preference to focus on its legal rights to the Bellevue Hill property is understandable.The fourteenth defendant’s solicitor’s Affidavit also includes evidence about the current occupation of the Bellevue Hill property by the fourteenth defendant’s wife (the fifteenth defendant) and their eight“children”. The fourteenthdefendant is concerned that enforcement action by NAB will render his wife and children homeless.Further information about the domestic circumstances of the fifteenth defendant and the eight children is provided in an Affidavit affirmed on 11 August 2024 by the fifteenth defendant herself. In that Affidavit she explains that she is a homemaker and that four of the children are aged 19, 22, 23 and 24. The eldest was previously employed full time but has recently decided to return to full time study which will necessitate financial assistance from her parents. The second eldest is employed by an“accounting company”. The next two are university students. All four previously lived out of home but have now returned for want of financial support from their parents.The other four children are aged between 14 and 18, one is at a private boys’school and the other three are at the local government school, having recently been removed from a private girls’school. As a result of the restraining orders made in these proceedings, the fifteenth defendant says she has been deprived of access to bank accounts and cash. She has been forced to change the girls’school.Some of the children have undertaken some paid work to assist the family.The fifteenth defendant says that one of the adult children has developed“psychological issues while carrying some burden of the family”. Some of the school-aged children have found the recent events disruptive which has manifested itself in behavioural issues. The fifteenth defendant has personally also found recent events disruptive.The fifteenth defendant hired PT Business Advisory Pty Ltd to“help me review my bank statements and work out the ordinary and reasonable living expenses of my household”. As a result, the fifteenth defendant has been advised that her total annualised family living expenses is $921,704. That figure includes $284,509 in schooling costs per year, which the fifteenth defendant expects willdecrease now that three of the children have been moved to a local government school.Since April 2023, the fifteenth defendant has had to borrow money for expenses. She has borrowed $518,000 from family and friends.Turning then to NAB’s application, and as I have stated above, there is no dispute that there is a default under the mortgage and that in August 2023 NAB gave notice of the default.The plaintiff, who obtained the restraining orders over the Bellevue Hill property, accepts that NAB’s interest in the property ought to be excluded from the restraining orders. That is correct. For the purposes of theProceeds of Crime Act, NAB’s rights as mortgagee is an“interest”and, hence,“property”under the definitions in s338. There are three restraining orders which concern the Bellevue Hill property. The first two were made under ss18(2)(a) and 18(2)(b) which each provide for a restraining order to be made over specified property when the Court is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is property“of the suspect”(as that term is defined). NAB is not the suspect. The third restraining order was made under s19 which provides for a restraining order to be made over property ifthere are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the“proceeds of [an] indictable offence”. There are no grounds to suspect that NAB’s interest in the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence. There is no basis for a restraining order over the property of NAB in the Bellevue Hill property.The fourteenthand fifteenthdefendants have not identified any legal reason why NAB is not entitled to the orders it seeks.The only non-legal reason given by the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants to resist the immediate exclusion of NAB’s interest is the fear of disruption to the accommodation of the fifteenth defendant and the eight children living with her. Whilst one may have sympathy for the problems which will confront the family if the Bellevue Hill property is eventually sold, there is nothing in this case whichsets it apart from any other case of a default on a bank loan secured over a family home.It is submitted that NAB will not suffer any prejudice if there is a delay in NAB’s interest being excluded from the restraining orders. The fourteenth defendant points out that NAB is a registered first mortgagee over a prestige property in Bellevue Hill. The Court is asked to assume that property value goes up. However, the evidence does not permit the Court to conclude that NAB is not exposed to potential prejudice in the face of a proven and growing debt of $9.5 million. There is no evidence about the current value of the property. In any event, the rights which NAB wants to enforce are private rights against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants which NAB is entitled to enforce in accordance with its own interests. NAB does not want a delay.The prospect of an alternative arrangement being made by which other assets might be released from restraining orders and realised to fund repayment of the debt to NAB does not assist the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants’cause. First, the evidence does not justify confidence that the other assets are of sufficient value to make it unnecessary for NAB to take possession of the Bellevue Hill property in any event. It appears to be accepted that the real property at Richmond and Tarlo are not valuable enough on their own. Nothing concrete is known about the other property. On the evidence, it is not even known if some of the other property is lawfully available to the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants.Secondly, the mere existence of alternative assets does not disentitle NAB from exercising its private rights in relation to the Bellevue Hill property if that is what NAB wants to do.Thirdly, there is nothing in theProceeds of Crime Actwhich gives the Court power to modify, restrict or diminish NAB’s private rights as against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants. In his NoticeofMotion filed on 9August2024, the fourteenth defendant relies upon ss24(1)(d) and 39(1). Section 24(1) provides:24 Allowance for expenses(1) The court may allow any one or more of the following to be met out of property, or a specified part of property, covered by a restraining order:(a) the reasonable living expenses of the person whose property is restrained;(b) the reasonable living expenses of any of the dependants of that person;(c) the reasonable business expenses of that person;(d) a specified debt incurred in good faith by that person.The text of s24(1)(d) makes clear that the Court is empowered to \"allow”property to be applied to a particular debt even though the property is subject to a restraining order. The Court may give permission, with the effect that the proceeds of crime authority may not subsequently oppose the property being used in that way. Even if the Court were to make such an order in this case, it would not be enough for the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants’purpose. There is nothing in s24(1)(d) which empowers the Court to go further and compel a lender to accept funds from a particular source. Even more pertinently to the current circumstances, the Court is not empowered to compel a lender to forego funds from some source to which the lender is entitled.Section 39(1) does not assist either. It provides:39Ancillary orders(1) The court that made a restraining order, or any other court that could have made the restraining order, may make any ancillary orders that the court considers appropriate and, without limiting the generality of this, the court may make any one or more of the following orders:(a) an order varying the property covered by the restraining order;(b) an order varying a condition to which the restraining order is subject;(c) an order relating to an undertaking required under section 21;(ca) an order directing the suspect in relation to the restraining order to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out all of his or her * interests in property, and his or her liabilities;(d) an order directing the owner or a previous owner of the property (including, if the owner or previous owner is a body corporate, aspecified director of the body corporate) to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property;(da) if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person (other than the owner or a previous owner) has information relevant to identifying, locating or quantifying the property--an order directing the person to give a sworn statement to a specified person, within a specified period, setting out particulars of, or dealings with, the property;(e) if the * Official Trustee is ordered under section 38 to take custody and control of property:(i) an order regulating the manner in which the Official Trustee may exercise its powers or perform its duties under the restraining order; or(ii) an order determining any question relating to the property, including a question relating to the liabilities of the owner or the exercise of powers or the performance of duties of the Official Trustee; or(iii) an order directing any person to do anything necessary or convenient to enable the Official Trustee to take custody and control of the property;(f) an order giving directions about the operation of the restraining order and any one or more of the following:(i) a forfeiture order that covers the same property as the restraining order;(ii) a pecuniary penalty order or a literary proceeds order that relates to the same offence as the restraining order;(g) an order requiring a person whose property is covered by a restraining order, or who has effective control of property covered by a restraining order, to do anything necessary or convenient to bring the property within the jurisdiction.The power conferred on the Court under this provision is broad, but it is not unlimited. The ambit of s39 is to be construed consistently with the language of the text and the purpose of all the provisions of theProceeds of Crime Act:Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Kanjo & Ors[2019] QCA 143 at [43]. As for the text, s39 empowers the Court to make an“ancillary”order. The ordinary meaning of“ancillary”is to be“subordinate, subsidiary. Later also in weakened sense: supplementary, additional; accompanying”:Oxford English Dictionary,online ed, accessed 15 August 2024.Within s39,“ancillary”evidently means ancillary to a restraining order which the Court has already made (or could have made):Kanjo’s Caseat [50]–[51].The Court’s power is limited to making orders which the Court“considers appropriate”. Appropriateness is not some unconstrained notion of right, proper or fair. In the first instance appropriateness must be informed by the objects of theProceeds of Crime Act. The principal objects are set out in s5 in the following terms:Principal objectsThe principal objects of this Act are:(a) to deprive persons of the proceeds of offences, the instruments of offences, and benefits derived from offences, against the laws of the Commonwealth or the non - governing Territories; and(b) to deprive persons of literary proceeds derived from the commercial exploitation of their notoriety from having committed offences; and(ba) to deprive persons of unexplained wealth amounts that the person cannot satisfy a court were not derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from certain offences; and(c) to punish and deter persons from breaching laws of the Commonwealth or the non - governing Territories; and(d) to prevent the reinvestment of proceeds, instruments, benefits, literary proceeds and unexplained wealth amounts in further criminal activities; and(da) to undermine the profitability of criminal enterprises; and(e) to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to trace proceeds, instruments, benefits, literary proceeds and unexplained wealth amounts; and(f) to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, and other international agreements relating to proceeds of crime; and(g) to provide for confiscation orders and restraining orders made in respect of offences against the laws of the States or the * self - governing Territories to be enforced in the other Territories.The objects were summarised inCommissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Hart(2018)262 CLR 76;[2018] HCA 1at [32]-[33], where Gordan J said:“[32] The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (“the POCA”) is intended to, and does, prevent criminals from enjoying the fruits of their crimes, deprive them of the proceeds of and benefits derived from criminal conduct, prevent the reinvestment of those proceeds and benefits in further criminal activities, punish and deter breaches of laws, and enable law enforcement authorities to trace the fruits of offences.[33] It achieves these objects through a confiscation scheme which provides for orders restraining persons from disposing of or otherwise dealing with particular property, forfeiture orders, automatic forfeiture of property following conviction of a serious offence and pecuniary penalty orders.”Section39 empowers the Court to make an order which it considers appropriate having regard to these purposes. The Court is empowered to make an order which the Court considers appropriate to support the particular restraining order in question.Such an operation of s39 is confirmed by the example orders. Nine examples of orders which the Court may make are set out in the sub-paragraphs of s39. The examples are not exhaustive. All of the examples relate to the efficacy of the restraining orders, the efficacy of the Official Trustee’s custody and control of the property and the information gathering work of the proceeds of crime authorityIn the circumstances of this case, s39 does not empower the Court to make any order which has as its object the restraint on the exercise of NAB’s private rights against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants. Such an order will not serve any of the objects of the statute. It could not be considered appropriate to support the restraining orders which have been made over the Bellevue Hill property, nor the restraining orders which have been made over any of the other property referred to in the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion. Such orders would not conform to or resemble any of the sample orders set out in s39.As a further matter as they concern NAB the purpose of the orders proposed by the fourteenthdefendant is to compel NAB to give up its interests in the BellevueHill property. Given that Division 3 of Part 2-1 of theProceeds of Crime Actspecifically contemplates that interests such as that which NAB has in the Bellevue Hill property ought not to be disrupted by restraining orders, thearrangement which the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants seek to implement would be inconsistent with the statutory regime. That is, unless NAB agrees.I have also had regard to the fact that the orders merely exclude NAB’s interest from the restraining orders which apply to the Bellevue Hill property, and permit NAB to exercise its rights as mortgagee in conformity with the restraining orders. The orders do not enforce any of NAB’s private rights against the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants. NAB does not seek a judgment for the debt or an order for possession or a writ for possession. Such matters are not before the Court. If there be a proper basis for it, the fourteenth or fifteenth defendants may resist an application for such orders when NAB makes it. That application will be the appropriate occasion to canvas any issue arising from the private rights and obligations asserted by NAB.For these reasons, I accepted NAB’s application on 12 August 2024. I also dismissed the fourteenth defendant’s application for a stay.The balance of the fourteenth defendant’s Notice of Motion (prayers 2, 3 and 4) seeks orders under ss24(1)(d) and 39(1) to facilitate an alternative arrangement for the repayment of the debt to NAB. The fourteenth defendant submitted that, even after NAB’s interest is excluded from the restraining orders, there is still utility in those prayers being heard and determined by the Court at a future date.Whether or not that is correct depends on whether the Court’s powers under s24(1)(d) and/or whether s39(1) would permit the Court to compel the plaintiff (as opposed to NAB) to accommodate an alternative arrangement which (on this hypothesis) is acceptable to NAB. NAB does not consent to the arrangement currently proposed so the issue is hypothetical. However, it may be presumed that the fourteenth and fifteenth defendants wish to continue negotiations. On the evidence currently before the Court, it cannot be said that there is no prospect of agreement and hence no utility in the balance of the motion being heard at a later date.In those circumstances, I made orders for the balance of the fourteenthdefendant’s motion to be prepared for hearing on 22November2024.In relation to the Notice of Motion filed by NAB on 27 May 2024, the following orders were made on 12 August 2024:Exclusion OrderPursuant to ss 29 and 31 of theProceeds of Crime Act 2002(Cth) (Act), the interest of National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) as registered mortgagee of the property specified in Schedule One to these orders (the Property) [Schedule 1 omitted], including both NAB’s legal interest and all rights powers and privileges in connection with the mortgage, are excluded from the restraining orders made on 31 January 2023 (Restraining Orders).Mortgagee Sale OrderWithout limiting order 1 above, NAB, their agents and/or legal representatives, and/or any receivers (such term to include receivers and managers) appointed by NAB are permitted to deal with the property for the purpose of effecting its sale pursuant to the terms of its registered mortgage AR561384, including:taking possession of the property;exercise its power of sale with respect to the property; andapply the proceeds from the sale of the property to discharge the amounts owing and secured by NAB’s mortgage over the property.In the event that the power of sale is exercised under NAB’s registered mortgage over the Property (whether by NAB, NAB’s agents or anyreceiver appointed by NAB), NAB is to provide to the plaintiff, by email to the plaintiff’s legal representatives at EC- CAL@afp.gov.au, copies of the following documents 72 hours prior to completion of any sale:a copy of any contract of sale;details in writing of the time and place of settlement and settlement sheets;a copy of any Australian Taxation Office foreign resident capital gains withholding clearance certificate or variation certificate;a copy of the statement of adjustments and the settlement statement;an itemised schedule of costs, charges, and expenses incurred in the sale of the property together with copies of all documents associated with the sale, including the tax invoice for any agent's commission payable on the sale and the memorandum of fees for any legal fees associated with the conveyance; andany other documents evidencing the disbursement of the sale price reasonably requested by the Plaintiff.Following completion of any sale of the property pursuant to NAB’s mortgage (whether by NAB, its agent or any receiver appointed by NAB):the \"net proceeds of sale\" (as defined below) together with any interest on that amount shall continue to be subject to the terms of the restraining orders as restrained property, until further order of the Court (subject to Part 2-1 Division 6 of the Act); andpursuant to section 38 of the Act, the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (Official Trustee) is to take custody and control of the \"net proceeds of sale\" together with any interest on that amount.The“net proceeds of sale”referred to in these orders means, in respect of the Property, the sale price less the following in the following order:First, any amounts payable on account of any outstanding rates, land tax, and other charges due to Sydney Water, and any other adjustment made upon completion of the sale of the property;Second, all amounts owing under NAB’s registered mortgage AR561384 in respect of the property, including without limitation:reasonable legal fees and disbursements payable to the solicitor acting for NAB in respect of the sale of the property;reasonable real estate agents' fees and commission in respect of the sale of the property;reasonable commercial selling agents’fees and disbursements payable to any property management firm engaged to secure and/or maintain and/or present the property; andthe reasonable fees and disbursements of any receiver and manager appointed by NAB in respect of the property;Third, any other reasonable expenses in connection with the sale of the property;provided that NAB has provided to the plaintiff written evidence in support of those amounts prior to completion.The Court orders that, to the extent necessary, the restraining orders are varied pursuant to section 39(1) of the Act such that NAB and any receivers appointed by NAB are permitted to deal with the property andthe proceeds from the sale of the property in the manner set out in these orders and notations.Liberty to restore on 24 hours’written notice.There be no order as to costs with respect to NAB’s Notice of Motion, noting that such costs are payable under the terms of NAB’s loan agreement and mortgage and that such costs are secured and will form part of the debt secured over the property.These orders be entered forthwith.In relation to the Notice of Motion filed by the fourteenth defendant on 9August2024, the following orders were made on 12 August 2024:Dismiss order 1 in the Notice of Motion of the fourteenth defendant dated 9 August 2024The fourteenth defendant is to file and serve any evidence and submissions by 30 September 2024.The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is to file and serve any evidence and submissions in reply by 28 October 2024.A joint court book is to be provided to the Associate of Faulkner J 7 days prior to the hearing.The Notice of Motion filed by the fourteenth defendant on 9 August 2024 is set down for hearing before Faulkner J, with an estimate of 1 day, on 22 November 2024.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The relevant conduct is the use byentities trading under the business name‘PTX Markets’of the plaintiffs’product pricing information,including with the symbol orprefix‘IDX’,which the plaintiffs allege has the tendency to suggest torelevantconsumers that those entities are associated with the plaintiffs, when they are not.BackgroundThe following summary of the factual background is drawn from the affidavit ofMrSamuel Johnson, the managing director ofthe first plaintiff,iSAM Securities (UK) Limited, who was not cross-examined.Plaintiffs’ businessThe plaintiffs are members of agroup of relatedcompanies (which, for convenience I will refer to collectively asiSAM)providingliquidity, brokerage, technology and risk management services globally.Relevantly for this proceeding, iSAM's business involves providing pricing and‘liquidity’(that is, the ability for their clients to trade) in respect of foreign exchangespottransactions, indices(involving taking a position on a share index), and commodities products to itsclients who areretail brokers.iSAM's businessmodel is in effect, to bridge the gap between large banking and financial institutions (who themselves provide liquidity) (Tier 1 LPs), and retail brokers, who‘consume’liquidity(that is, enter into trades)for the purpose of offering trading services totheirretail client end-users.iSAM competes with a number of other‘liquidity providers’(LPs) who also aggregate pricing for a liquidity pool of different Tier 1 LPs to create a single price able to be traded upon by retail brokers. The retail clients of the retail brokers are too small to be able to deal directly with LPs such as iSAM.iSAM competes with other LPs by offering its own unique pricing to its retail broker clients (iSAM's Pricing).The retail broker clients of iSAM enter into a liquidity agreement with iSAM, whereby the retail broker pays a fee to iSAM in exchange for the ability to access and consume iSAM's Pricing and liquidity.The retail broker may then, in turn and with iSAM's agreement, use iSAM's Pricing to offer a trading service to its own customers.Each liquidity agreement governs the terms on which iSAM's Pricing is able to be usedby that broker.Although retail brokers may choose to contract with more than one LP (for example, because particular LPs may specialise indifferentfinancial productsto other LPs), a retail broker would not ordinarily sign up with more than three to four LPs at any one time due to the associated costs.A retail broker wouldgenerallyhave no need to contract with more than one LP who offered the same products and pricing.Retail brokersaccessthe pricing from a LP via a piece of software commonly referred to as a‘liquidity bridge’and then make this pricing (sometimes after applying their own adjustments) available to the end consumer via trading platform software, usually industry standard‘MetaTrader’software platforms (including what are known asthe‘MT4’and‘MT5’platforms).Each retail broker has its own liquidity bridge (which is typically provided by a third-party provider), and through that platform is able to accessand trade upon the pricing of the LPs with which they have an agreement.A retail broker cannot access or view the pricing offered by a LP withwhichit does not have a liquidity agreement.When iSAM's Pricing is displayed to a retail client through a liquidity bridge, iSAM's designated 'symbol' (being a combination of letters and numbers) for each product is also displayed.The symbol allows a retail broker to identify the relevant financial product to which the pricing attaches and identifies iSAM as the source of the relevant pricing.iSAM's symbol in respect ofthe twelveproducts it refers to as 'index swaps' is distinctive from symbols used by other LPs.This is because it is generally more common for LPs to refer to 'index swaps' as 'contracts for difference' (orCFDs), andaccording to Mr Johnson, iSAM is the only LP to use the prefix‘IDX’foritsindex swapproducts.In contrast, iSAM’s symbols for itsforeign exchange and commoditiesproducts (of which there are around125)appear to bemore descriptive in nature(CB274).iSAM's Pricing is calculated through an aggregation of the pricing available from its liquidity pool of approximately ten Tier 1 LPs at any one time.The performance of the Tier 1 LPs making up the relevant pool is activelymonitored,and the pool of Tier 1 LPs is subject to change from time to time by iSAM, usually in light of the competitiveness of pricing and reliability of execution (i.e.,the successful completion of trades at or around the prices quoted).In order to produce iSAM's Pricing, the 'raw' pricing received from the Tier 1 LPs is also processed in various ways to make it consumable by the retail brokers. This is achieved by automated systems designed and maintained by iSAM which are optimised to deliver competitive pricing and reliable execution to iSAM's retail broker clients. The relevant algorithms and processes applied in order to calculate iSAM's Pricing are not disclosed by iSAM to third parties and are regarded by iSAM as proprietary in nature.iSAM utilises the different prices it obtains from the price feeds of the various Tier 1 LPs to create iSAM's Pricing, being a price feed comprising a single price for each product which it thenmakes availableto its clients through a liquidity bridge, and which is capable of being traded upon bythem.iSAM's commercial arrangements for the provision of its pricing varyfrom client to client.In some cases,iSAM allowsaretail broker client to 'recycle' iSAM's Pricing and provide it to other retail brokers (also referred to as 'white labelling').In effect, this allows those clients (Recycling Brokers) to act as LPs themselves.Typically, when this occurs, the Recycling Broker client will add their own mark-up to iSAM's Pricing to produce their own price feed that is derived from, but not identical to, iSAM's Pricing.In doing so, the Recycling Broker may use iSAM's 'symbols' for each financial product offered, or they may choose to use their own naming conventions.Thisarrangement can be commercially advantageous to iSAM, because it not only increases the number of retail broker clients who have liquidity arrangements with iSAM, but iSAM is also able to make a profit on the fee it charges a Recycling Broker for use of iSAM's Pricing.Relationship between iSAM andMr PressIn around July 2019,iSAM entered into a consultancy agreement withMrPress and Forexco Australia, pursuant to whichMrPress and Forexco Australia were engaged to provide certain services to iSAM (Consultancy Agreement).Part ofMrPress' rolewas to assist Forexco Australia to promote the revenue growth of iSAM, including by findingnew retail broker clients in the Australian marketforiSAM.The Consultancy Agreement came to an end,at the latest,inNovember2023, and since that time iSAM has had no business association withMrPress and Forexco Australia.The Consultancy Agreement, which is governed by English law and contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of English courts,includes a post termination restraint for a period ofsixmonths againstMrPress and Forexco Australia competing with iSAM.Emergence ofPTX MarketsInearlyDecember 2023,MrJohnsonfirst became aware of a competitor business, calling itself‘PTX Markets’(PTX), in discussions had with aprospectiveretail brokerclient, ETO Markets.ETO Markets is now a retail broker client of PTX.PTX appeared to be offering similar liquidity services to those offered by iSAM, in that it was acting as a LP and providing liquidity services to retail brokers.Shortly afterwards,MrJohnsonbecame aware of a suggestion thatMrPress may have some involvement with PTXand was in competition with iSAM,butMrPressdenied this.In late February 2024, theplaintiffs received further information from a retail broker in Sydney, Dolphin Markets,which suggestedthatMrPresswas marketing to brokers the services of PTX in a manner which appeared to be competing with iSAM.As a result of this information,MrJohnson instructed one of iSAM's employees (MrPhil Kim) who was already travelling to Australia in March, to make inquiries in the Australian market with respect toMrPress and PTX.On 25 March 2024,MrKim wrote an email toMrJohnsonsetting out the results of his inquiries while in Australia, which included discussions withMrDan Bent of Infinium Solutions,another market participant.Mr Bentbrought up his concern that PTX was related to iSAM and mentioned that he recognisedthat the naming conventionson the MT4 softwareforproducts offered byiSAM and PTXwereidentical.On 22 April 2024,MrJohnson received a copy of a screenshot from the liquidity bridge of ETO Markets, a retail broker client of PTX, whichshowed the‘symbol’of‘IDX.UK.100’being displayed as PTX's subscription code fora swap involvingthe FTSE100index.The prefix‘IDX’forindex swapproducts of this kind is a naming conventionused byiSAMas noted earlier.MrJohnson became immediately concerned that the use of iSAM's unique symbols by PTX suggestedthat PTX was using iSAM's Pricing and feeding it to its own retail broker clients.MrJohnson deposed that the reason for this was that all LPs, including iSAM, supply pricing to their clients under their designated symbols and for PTX to be showing pricing with iSAM’s symbols (particularly‘IDX’) strongly indicated that the underlying pricing was iSAM’sPricing.MrJohnson deposed that he did not know how, at the time the screenshot was taken on 22 April2024, PTX was obtaining iSAM’sPricing. An entity associated withMrPress, SRW Global Ltd(SRW Global), had previously been one of iSAM’s clients, but this relationship ceased in February 2024.MrJohnson deposed that there were at least four possible explanations,and he is presently unable to determine which is correct:a. that PTX still had access to theiSAM’sPricing by some other means since SRW Global’s offboarding (for example, from one of theplaintiffs’ other clients);b. that PTX was using different pricing after SRW Global’s offboarding in February 2024 but opted to keep using theplaintiff’s symbols;c. that PTX sourced theiSAM’sPricing from someone other than SRW Global in the first place; ord. that PTX had procured and was supplying pricing from another source but had opted to ‘re-name’ such pricing, using theplaintiff’s symbols.Correspondence between iSAM and the defendantsShortly after the screenshot was receivedfrom ETO Markets, iSAM’s solicitors in the United Kingdom, Harbottle & Lewis (H&L) sent a letter to the defendantsdated 24 April 2024raising allegations that the defendants were in breach of the Consultancy Agreement. The letter statesthat it is a‘letter before claim’in accordance with thePracticeDirection onPre-ActionConduct andProtocols (thePracticeDirection) contained inTheCivil Procedure Rules1998(UK)c12of the United Kingdom, and notes that the failure byMrPress to respond by the specified deadline‘may result in an application being made to the Court, without further reference to you. We suggest you urgently seek English legal advice’.The letter then sets out what are described as‘flagrant breaches of the obligations and restrictions set out in the Consultancy Agreement’and adds that whilethe plaintiffsare continuing to investigate matters,‘it is already apparent that serious wrongdoing has occurred as provisionally detailed below’. There follows various allegations regarding the conduct of activities under the PTX business name,including allegations that thedefendantshave been providing to their clients access to iSAM’sPricing and passing it off as their own in breach of the Consultancy Agreement (by reference to the screenshot taken on 22 April 2024) and misuse of iSAM’s confidential information.The letter set out eight‘actions’which H&L requiredthe defendants to take. It appears that the defendants did not respond to any of these action requirements, except‘action 4’which required PTX to change the MetaTrader symbols used by PTX to distinguish them from iSAM’s symbols. It appears thatPTXdidremove references to‘IDX’from its symbols used to price its productson around 15May 2024 after this letter was sent (CB 315).The H&L letter then concluded as follows, under the heading‘Next steps’:8.1 You are required to undertake ACTIONS 1-8 described above promptly and in accordance with the deadlines specified. We await receipt of the documentation requested, and undertakings sought. In the event that we do not hear from you accordingly, this matter will escalate, as indicated above.8.2 All our clients’ rights, and rights to all remedies, are expressly reserved, including their right to make a complaint to any competent regulatory body in respect of your conduct.8.3 Relevant to this, you will have noted references in this letter to potential action being taken against you in Australia, where you reside. To this end, we confirm that our client has also instructed Australian lawyers to pursue appropriate action against you in your home jurisdiction. You will be hearing from them shortly, we understand.8.4 We suggest you seek independent legal advice.On 26 April 2024, Corrs Chambers Westgarth(Corrs), the plaintiffs’Australian solicitors, sent a letter to the defendantswhich attacheda copy of the H&Lletter of 24 April 2024andstatedthatitoutlines‘very serious misconduct by you, which our client believes may entitle it–or its related entities–to pursue injunctive relief, declaratory relief, statutory compensation, damages, costs and/or interest on various grounds’, including contravention of theCorporations Act 2001(Cth),theAustralian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001(Cth)and the ACL. TheCorrsletterwenton to state that Corrshadbeen instructed to investigate all available avenues to preserve and vindicate the plaintiffs’rights and, as‘the full extent of your wrongdoing is currently unknown and subject to continued investigation by our client and that in order to provide our client with sufficient information to decide whether to commence proceedings and/or to determine the identify of prospective respondents to such proceedings’, a request was made that the defendants provide the information sought in particular identified paragraphs of the H&L letterof 24 April 2024. In relation to a potential proceeding under the ACL, theCorrsletter states:Australian Consumer Law11. We refer to the section of the H&L Letter titled ‘Activities of PTX Markets’. On information currently available, the misconduct described therein appears to involve conduct outside Australia by bodies corporate carrying on business within Australia (within section 5 of the CCA). Our client believes this may entitle it to obtain relief for:a. Conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive, contrary to section 18 of the ACL; and/orb. Unconscionable conduct contrary to section 21 of the ACL12. If our client pursues proceedings against you in respect of these contraventions, it would be entitled to seek an injunction, declaratory relief, damages and/or other relief the court think appropriate, together with costs and interest. As outlined in the H&L Letter, our client’s losses are substantial and will continue to accrue should you fail to comply with the actions outlined by H&L.13. Further, to the extentthat your misconduct described in ‘Diverting business’ is not characterised as having occurred in the course of providing financial services, then the ACL would apply and breaches of section 18 and/or 21 accordingly may arise.Next steps14. Should you fail to undertake the actions outlined in the H&L Letter promptly and in accordance with the deadlines specified, our client expressly reserves its rights to initiate proceedings in Australia against you without further notice, seeking such relief as may be appropriate (including injunctive relief to restrain continuing contravention of the ACL, Corporations Act and/or ASIC Act and damages).On 2 May 2024 the then solicitors for the defendants, HWL Ebsworth(HWL),responded to H&L by a letter denying any breach of theConsultancyAgreementand requiring H&L to disclose the evidence it was relying on. Also on 6 May 2024, HWL responded to Corrsby aletter denying a breach of, relevantly, the ACL.On 9 May 2024, H&Lsent a furtherletter to HWL which, after referring to‘your clients’breaches of their obligationsunderthe Consultancy Agreement went on(emphasis added):Our clients are not obliged to provide disclosure or to further evidence their case at this stage.Relevant to this were the express observations in the Letter Before Claim that: (a) much of the relevant material will be within your possession or control; and (b) our clients’ investigations are ongoing. (Indeed, in addition to the evidence referenced in the Letter BeforeClaim, our clients have subsequently obtained further written evidence from one their clients(which is also a client of PTX) that PTX has been and is continuing to offer full FX liquidity, in direct competition with out clients.)It is correct that the evidential picture is still emerging, and that the full extent of your clients’ wrongdoing is not yet known to our clients.It would be a mistake on your clients’ part to believe that this, and the fact that our clients (prudently) are not prepared to identify their sources and witnesses at this stage, means that our clients cannot and will not pursue this matter and seek appropriate remedies from the Court.A mistaken belief of that nature appears to underly your clients’ refusal to take any of the 8 Actions required of them in the Letter BeforeClaim. (Even the limited confirmation you have provided regarding document preservation falls well short of what was requested.) Your clients had an opportunity, in taking the required Actions, to mitigate the damage caused to our client and to forestall the need for proceedings. They have spurned that opportunity, with the result that our clients have no option but to escalate matters. To that end (inter alia) leading Counsel has been instructed, with a view to preparation of Particulars of Claim.All our clients’rights remain expressly reserved in all respects. We shall draw all relevant conduct and correspondence to the attention of the Court on the issue of costs and otherwise.HWL responded by letter dated 13 May2024, which after noting the statement in the H&L letter that particulars of claim were now being prepared, went on to state that the commencement of proceedings by the plaintiffs would be premature given the matters raised in their letter. H&L responded by letter dated 16 May 2024(emphasis added):Your reference to the Practice Direction on pre-action conduct is misconceived.Contrary to your assertion, your client has declined to engage with the substance of our client’s claims. Your correspondence to date does not constitute a proper Response to the Letter Before Claim, and indicates that no such Response will be forthcoming. Your client’s position is one of bare denial. Moreover, your client has refused to take any of the actions requested of him.As such, it would appear that the pre-action correspondence has run its course. Our clients are proceeding accordingly and their position is unchanged.In practice, your client has a short window in which to adopt a different stance and engage with our clients. However, further correspondence of the sort sent to us to date will not forestall escalation of this matter.All of our clients’rights remain expressly reserved in all respects. We shall draw all relevant conduct and correspondence to the attention of the Court on the issue of costs and otherwise.On 17 May 2024, Corrs sent a further letter to HWL responding to that firm’s letter dated 6 May 2024,repeating the requests made for information sought in the H&L letter of 24 April 2024 and adding:We are instructed tobeginpreparation of an application for preliminary discovery to provide our client with sufficient information to decide whether to commence proceedings and/or to determine the identity of prospective respondent(s) to such proceedings. We will make that application without further notice to you should the information requested not be forthcoming.The letter ended by the statement that‘Our client’s rights remain reserved’.Despite the reference in the H&L letters to escalation of the matter if the defendants failed to engage with the requests made,no proceedings have been commenced in the United Kingdom or Australia in respect of the matters raisedby either H&L or Corrsin this correspondence,other than this proceeding seeking preliminary discovery.Further investigationMrJohnson’s affidavit sets out the various enquiries which the plaintiffshave undertaken to establish theidentityof theentityor entities conducting business under the name PTX, and how its pricing information has been accessed by PTX. This included engaging RSM Australia Pty Ltd (RSM) to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the association of the defendants with entities calling themselves PTX, and which entity or entities calling themselves PTX are using iSAM’sPricing, and from which entity or entities that pricingwasobtained. RSM’s reportdated26 June 2024could not answer the last two questions, but in relation to the first, RSM concluded that the business name‘PTX Markets’is owned by a Vanuatu entity, Forexco International Limited of whichMrPress is a director, and he has a connection with a Vanuatu company called Prime Trading Services Pty Ltd which has previously traded as PTX Markets.There appear to be at least two other companies which have traded as PTX Markets, being Prime Trading Services Pty Ltd (registered in St Vincent & TheGrenadines) and Prime Treasury Services Pty Ltd (an Australian company). MrPressis a director of the latter, but his connection with the former is unclear.MrJohnson deposes that on 17June 2024, MrCampbell Sedy from Titan FX (a foreign exchange, metal and commodities broker) provided the plaintiffs with an excel spreadsheet entitled‘PTX Product Schedule’which contained 11 index swap products that used an‘IDX’symbol. MrSedy told the plaintiffs that he had thought that PTX was using iSAM’s pricing because‘their index products had your exact naming structure’.Preliminary discovery to ascertain identity of prospective defendantsPursuant to anamendedsummons filed in Court on 13 August 2024, the plaintiffs seek underrule5.2 of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court the following orders:7.An order pursuant to rule 5.2(2)(a) of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court that the First Defendant attend the Court to be examined before a Registrar of this Court as to the identity of the person, persons, entity or entities:a.offering, supplying or making available services under the business name \"PTX Markets\" or through the website, URL: ptxmarkets.com.b.supplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs' product pricing information or symbols, including but not limited to price feed information with the prefix \"IDX\".8.An order pursuant to rule 5.2(2)(b) of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court that within 7 days of the date of this order, the Defendants give discovery to the Plaintiffs, of:a.all documents in the Defendants' possession created, dated or received during the period 1 July 2021 to date, relating to the identity of the person, persons, entity or entities offering, supplying or making available services under the business name \"PTX Markets\" or through the website, URL: ptxmarkets.com.b.all documents in the Defendants' possession created, dated or received during the period 1 July 2021 to date relating to the identity of the person, persons, entity or entitiessupplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs' product pricing information or symbols, including but not limited to price feed information with the prefix \"IDX\".Rule 5.2 of the UCPR providesrelevantly:(1)This rule applies if it appears to the court that -(a)the applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to sufficiently ascertain the identity or whereabouts of a person (\"the person concerned\") for the purpose of commencing proceedings against the person, and(b)some person other than the applicant (\"the other person\") may have information, or may have or have had possession of a document or thing, that tends to assist in ascertaining the identity or whereabouts of the person concerned.(2)The court may make either or both of the following orders against the other person -(a)an order that the other person attend the court to be examined as to the identity or whereabouts of the person concerned,(b)an order that the other person must give discovery to the applicant of all documents that are or have been in the other person's possession and that relate to the identity or whereabouts of the person concerned.…Under r 5.1 of the UCPR, the expression‘identity orwhereabouts’is defined to include‘the name (as applicable), the place of residence, registered office, place of business or other whereabouts, and the occupation and sex, of the person against whom the applicant desires to bring proceedings, and also whether that person is an individual or a corporation.’Prayer 7 seeks to engage r 5.2(2)(a)by requiringthe first defendant,MrPress,toattend Court to be examinedbefore a Registrarand prayer 8 seeks to engage r 5.2(2)(b)by requiringthe provision of documents,in each case for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of the unidentified defendants to the proposed claim to be brought by the plaintiffs under s 18 of theACL.Reliance is placedin the alternative on the common law doctrines of preliminary discovery which are preserved through r 1.4 of the UCPR and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.The structure of prayers7 and 8 isalsoexplained on the basis that the plaintiffs seek to identify two categories of potential defendants: (a) the person or persons who made available financial products and services under the name‘PTX Markets’; and (b) the person or persons who supplied, received or used the plaintiffs’product pricing information in connection with the activities referred to in (a). The first category would be subject to a claim for breach of s 18 and the second category would be subject to a claim forknowing involvementin that breach.In order to obtain an order for preliminary discovery as to the identity of a potential defendant under r 5.2, the plaintiffs need to satisfy five requirements:The plaintiffs must have a desire to commence proceedings against as yet presently unidentified defendants, which must be a genuinely held and objectively based desire, albeit one which might be abandoned for good reason later discovered by them:Roads & Traffic Authority (NSW) v Care Park Pty Ltd[2012] NSWCA 35 at [106] and [119]. A‘desire’is to be characterised as something less fixed than an intention or purpose:Care Parkat [113]. In its ordinary meaning, a‘desire’is‘a strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen’(OxfordEnglishDictionary, online ed, August 2024).The plaintiffs must have made reasonable enquiries to ascertain the identity of the unidentified defendants. What is reasonable is a question of fact in all the circumstances, and the cost, delay and uncertainty of alternative measures is relevant. The availability of other means of ascertaining theidentify of a defendant does not in itself make it unreasonable to seek preliminary discovery:Roads & Traffic Authority (NSW) v Australian National Car Parks Pty Ltd[2007] NSWCA 114 at [14].The plaintiffs must have been unable to sufficiently ascertain the identity of the unidentified defendants. This directs attention to the information that the plaintiffs’reasonable enquiries to date have produced regarding the unidentified defendants, with the focus being on the objective sufficiency of the possessed information to fulfil the purpose ofcommencing proceedings to which the Court must have regard:Care Parkat [96]-[97].The defendants may have information that tends to assist in ascertaining theidentityof the unidentified defendants.Thisis directed to whether the information sought has the requisite tendency of assisting in identifying the relevant unidentified defendants, but the words‘may’and‘tends to assist’show that the plaintiffs do not have to establish in advance that the documents sought will necessarily reveal the identity of the prospective defendants:Australian National Car Parksat [16].Whether the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should make an order under r 5.2. The Court retains a discretion whether or not to make an order under r 5.2,which is to be exercised judicially and with regard to the case management provisions of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW)and theUCPR. Whileitisrelevant to the exercise of the Court’s discretion whether the plaintiffs have a prima facie case against the unidentified defendants, there is no requirement that the applicant establisha prima faciecase:Australian National Car Parksat[13];Age Co Ltd v Liu[2013] 82 NSWLR 268 at [89].However, ifthe claim to be brought is speculative, the discretion would not be exercised:Stewart v Miller[1979] 2 NSWLR 128 at 139-140.It is also necessary thatanyorder made pursuant to r 5.2 is limited to the information which is objectively necessary, in regard to the rules of Court, to enable proceedings to be commenced:The Ageat [88];Care Parkat [97].I will turn now to the application of each of these requirements to the facts of the present case.Whether the plaintiffs have a desire to commence proceedingsagainst presently unidentified defendants?In relation to the first requirement,MrJohnson’s evidence is that the plaintiffs are considering commencing a proceeding against the unidentified defendants,andMrPress,for breaches of the prohibition on misleadingordeceptive conductins 18 of the ACL. The allegation is that the unidentified defendants have conducteda business under the name‘PTX Markets’in a manner which has the tendency to suggest to consumers that PTX Markets is associated with, or in fact is, the plaintiffs,throughthe use of theplaintiffs’pricing in conjunction with symbols denoting its products (in particular the symbol IDX).It is also allegedthatMrPress was knowingly involved in that conduct and therefore potentially liable under s 236 of the ACL. While it is true thatMrJohnson only says that the plaintiffs are considering commencing such proceedings, the uncertaintyrelatesto the identity of the entities responsible for the relevant conduct,how those entities obtained the plaintiffs’pricing and/or symbolsand the extent of their use of that material.These matters are the subject of the application for preliminary discovery under r 5.2.MrJohnson also gives evidence that he is particularly concerned that this conduct has resulted in significant harm to the plaintiffs because the relevant entities using the PTX name have been representing through their use of the iSAM symbols and pricing, that they are affiliated with the plaintiffs while operating a competing business, thereby causing damage to its brand and business in Australia.Inmy opinion, this evidence together withthe enquiries made to deal with the areas of uncertainty mentionedin the previous paragraphand the correspondence sent by the plaintiffs’solicitors to the defendants referred to earlier,indicates a genuine and objectively based desire on the part of the plaintiffs to commence proceedings against the entities which have engaged in the alleged conduct for breach of s18 of the ACL, andMrPress as a person knowingly involved. That the desire is conditional in the sense that whether proceedings are ultimately brought depends on the clarification of theseuncertain matters, does not indicate that the desire does not exist, but rather that it might be abandoned as a result of information provided pursuant to the orders sought by way of preliminary discovery.For these reasons, the first requirement is satisfied.Whether the plaintiffs have made reasonable enquiriesto ascertain the identity of the unidentified defendants?As to the second requirement,MrJohnson gives evidence about the enquiries which have been made, as mentioned above. The defendants submit that the plaintiffs have failed to make reasonable enquiries in two respects.First,MrJohnson failed to instruct any of the plaintiffs’employees to check with any of iSAM’s past or present clientsas to whether they have been approached by anyone at PTX claiming to be associated with iSAM. While it did approach one retail broker, ETOMarkets, which became a client of PTX, it failed to ask that broker which legal entity using the PTX name it had contracted with. Ireject thissubmission. There is no certainty thatenquiries of this kind would necessarily establish the identity of the relevant entities. The evidencesuggeststhat a number of different entities have traded using the PTX Markets’name in the period since October 2021 and there is no certainty that any individual client or former client of iSAM would have dealt with such entities.Further, it is unlikely that clients or former clients of iSAM would be made aware of the entity or entities from which the unidentified defendants had obtained iSAM’s pricing information.Second, the defendants submitted thatMrJohnson’sevidence that iSAM’s symbol‘IDX’is unique should have been verified through retail brokers or other sources. I reject this submission. This is a matter on whichMrJohnson canand hasgivenevidence based onhis knowledge and experience in the markets in which iSAM operates,and that evidence did not need to be verified for the purposes of the present application.Whether the plaintiffs have been unable to sufficiently ascertain the identity of the unidentified defendants?As to the third requirement, it does not appear to be in dispute that the plaintiffs have not been able, despite their enquiries,toidentify the unidentified defendants.The plaintiffs did seek this information from Mr Press but he declined to provide it.Whether the defendants have information that tends to assist in ascertaining the identity of the unidentified defendants?As to the fourth requirement, it is clear from the evidence, and does not appear to be in dispute, thatMrPress has a clear connection with the business name‘PTX Markets’,becauseit is owned by a company registered in Vanuatu, Forexco International Ltd of whichMrPress is a director.Accordingly, it is likely he will have information of the kind sought.Whether the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should make an order under r 5.2?On the question as to whether the discretion should be exercised in favour of the plaintiffs, the defendants raised two matters: first, that the claim under s 18 of the ACLisspeculative and second that thecategories of preliminary discovery soughtaretoo broad.In my opinion, on the evidence before the Court, a claim against the unidentified defendants under s 18 of the ACL that their use of iSAM’sPricingfor index swap productsin conjunction withthe symbol‘IDX’in the course of a business of marketing financial products of that nature to retail brokers would not be speculative.The applicable principlesfordetermining whetherthere ismisleading or deceptive conduct under s 18in the context of the source of goods or servicesare well established:Self Care IP Holdings Pty Ltd v Allergan Australia Pty Ltd(2023) 97 ALJR 388; [2023] HCA 8 at [80]-[83]; see also the summaryby Stewart JinBrick Lane Brewing Co Pty Ltd v Torquay Beverage Co Pty Ltd[2023] FCA 66 at [28]-[41].Whileit is not necessary for the plaintiff to establish a particular reputation in order to prove misleadingordeceptive conduct, it is necessary that there is some association in the minds of the relevant sector of the public between the get-up or name used by the plaintiff and its products or services such thatit is likely thata consumer will be misledor deceivedbythe use of the sameor a similar get-up ornameby a competitor.Aswas statedinCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd[2007] FCAFC 70,by the Full Court (Black CJ, Emmett and Middleton JJ)at [99]:Whether or not there is a requirement for some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing off, there is no such requirement in relation to Part V of the Trade Practices Act. The question is not whether an applicant has shown a sufficient reputation in a particular get-up or name. Thequestion is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant’s product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of the knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant’s product.In circumstances where a plaintiff establishes that a name or symbol is distinctive of,or associated in the minds of the relevant target market with,the business of the plaintiff,andthat the use of that name or symbol by the defendant islikelyto deceive persons into supposing that there is an association between the plaintiff’s business and that of the defendant, it has a prima facie case for relief for breach of s 18.However, it is generally more difficult to establish thatthe use ofa descriptive or generic name as opposed to an invented namehas become associated with the plaintiff’s business such that its use by otherpersons who carry on the same type of businesswill be misleading or deceptive, and in such a case it may be necessary for the plaintiff to establish that the name has acquired a secondary meaning and become distinctive of the plaintiff’s business:Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre(1978) 140 CLR 216 at 229-230;Bohemia Crystal Pty Ltd v Host Corporation Pty Ltd[2018] FCA 235at[312]perBurley J.It is not, of course, appropriate on a preliminary discovery application to make a considered assessment of the ultimate merits of the prospective claim:The Ageat [102]-[104].In my view, based on the evidence before the Court, in particular, the evidence ofMrJohnson thatto his knowledge no other LP uses the naming convention indicated bythe IDX symbolfor index swap products, and the evidenceoftwo market participants(MrBent andMrSedy) that they recognised that when PTX used the IDX symbol in its pricing, it was adopting iSAM’s naming convention for the relevant index swaps,a claim thatuse by PTX of the‘IDX’symbol in its pricing of index swapsis a breach of s 18of the ACLis not speculative.However,I am not satisfied thatthe evidenceon this applicationestablishes thatthe other symbols used by iSAM for its products (such as those for spot foreign exchangeor commoditytransactions) whichappear to bedescriptive or generic in nature aresufficiently associated in the minds of persons in the target market withiSAM’s business.As to the breadth of the orders sought, the defendants submitted that the scope of the orders sought went further than reasonably necessary to identify the relevant unidentified defendantsand the time allowed (7 days) was too short. This submission was made in conjunction with a contention that the application had a collateral purpose, which was to assist the plaintiffs in proposedcourt proceedings in England in respect of the alleged breaches of the Consultancy Agreement.In my view, there is some force in the defendants’submission that prayers 7 and 8oftheamendedsummons go further than reasonably necessary to identify the relevant unidentified defendants. Without conceding that this so, the plaintiffs provided to the Court after the hearing, as a fallback position, a revised version of prayers 7 and 8 which are as follows:7.An order pursuant to rule 5.2(2)(a) of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the CourtthattheFirst Defendant attendtheCourttobeexaminedbeforea Registrar of this Court as to the identity of the person, persons, entity or entities:(a)offering, supplying or making available liquidity and/or brokerage services, includingbut notlimitedto,theprovision ofpricinginformationwithrespectto financial products or financial services, under the business name “PTX Markets” or through the website, URL: ptxmarkets.com(b)supplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs’ product pricing information or symbols,includingbutnotlimitedtopricefeedinformationwiththeprefix“IDX”.8.Anorderpursuanttorule5.2(2)(b)oftheUCPRortheinherentjurisdictionofthe Court that within 7 days of the date of this order, the Defendants give discovery(verified in accordance with rule 21.4 of the UCPR)to the Plaintiffs, of:(a)all documents in the Defendants’ possession created, dated or received duringtheperiod[1June*or1August**]2023todate,revealingthe identity of the person, persons, entity or entitiesoffering, supplying or making available liquidity and/or brokerageservices, including but not limited to, the provision of pricing information withrespect tofinancial products or financial services,under the business name “PTX Markets” or through the website, URL: ptxmarkets.com.(b)all documents in the Defendants’ possession created, dated or received duringtheperiod[1June*or1August**]2023todaterevealing the identity of the person, persons, entity or entities supplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs’ product pricing information or symbols, including but not limited to price feed information with the prefix “IDX”.In relation to prayer 7 (in both its original and revised form), in my view a more time efficient andcost-effectiveway for the plaintiffs to obtain the information soughtfrom Mr Pressis through an affidavit byhim, rather than an examination before the Registrar.MrPress is likely to have knowledge of all the matters dealt with by prayer 7 and can give an affidavit deposing as to that knowledge. While r5.2 contemplates an examination before the Registrar, the Court has power in its inherent jurisdiction to order that the information be supplied by an affidavit: see e.g.,Pritchard Lees Pty Ltd v Heather[2013] NSWSC 1521 at [17]-[20].In the present case, provision of the information by an affidavit appears to me to be the more appropriate,justand efficient (in terms of time and expense)course. It is also necessary to specify in the order the time period which is to be addressed, which should be 1 June 2023to the date of the orderfor the reasons given at [78] in relation to prayer 9 of the amended summons.In relation to prayer 8 in its original form, the specified period (from 1 July 2021 to date) and the nexus imported by the word‘relating’have the potential to impose a considerable burden on the defendants. I am conscious that the Court in exercising the discretion under r 5.2 to grant preliminary discovery takes into account thespecial andintrusive nature ofsuch reliefand seeks to limit theform of anyorder made to what is reasonably necessary to provide the relevant information sought.The revised version of prayer 8 addresses both of these concerns in a manner which I consider to be reasonable.I will adopt the starting date of 1 June 2023for the reasonsgivenat [78] below.In my opinion it is alsonecessary tolimitthe ordertothe plaintiffs’pricing information to that which concernsproduct symbolswiththe prefix IDX for the reason given above.The revised form, with this change, in my view goes no further than is reasonably necessary to enable the plaintiffs to establish the identity of the person or persons of the entities whichengaged in the conduct which they allege to contravene s 18 of the ACL, and those knowingly involved in that conduct. While there is some overlap between prayers 7 and 8,in my viewthe plaintiffs are entitled to seethedocuments in the possession of the defendants whichidentify the persons referred to notwithstanding that this is a matter which will beaddressed in the affidavit provided by Mr Press.I reject the defendants’submission that this proceeding is brought for a collateral purpose (see [51] above).This proceeding is for preliminary discovery in relation to a claim under s 18 of the ACL for conduct bythe unidentifieddefendants who are not parties to the Consultancy Agreement and will raise different issues to a claimagainst the defendants concerning theallegedbreaches of the Consultancy Agreement.The correspondence sent by H&L and Corrs made very clear that claims for breach of the Consultancy Agreement were being treated separately from the claim for breach of s 18 of the ACL.Further, the potential for overlapbetweenthe information provided in response to the orders to be madein this proceeding andany claim for breach of the Consultancy Agreement will be reduced by the more limited scope of the orders to be made, and to the extent that there isanoverlap, the plaintiffs would need to obtain a release from theHarmanundertaking (as was accepted by counsel at the hearing).Preliminary discovery of documents from defendantsBy theamendedsummons, the plaintiffs seek pursuant to r 5.3 of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, the following order for preliminary discovery:9.An order pursuant to rule 5.3(1) of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of theCourtthatwithin7daysofthedateofthisorder,theDefendantsgivediscoverytothe Plaintiffs, of all documents in the Defendants’ possession created, dated orreceived during theperiod 1 July2021to date evidencing, recording orrelating tothe supply, receipt or use of thePlaintiffs’ product pricing information or symbols,including but not limited to price feed information with the prefix “IDX”.Rule 5.3(1)of the UCPR provides relevantly:If it appears to the court that:(a)the applicant may be entitled to make a claim for relief from the court against a person (the prospective defendant) but, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to obtain sufficient information to decide whether or not to commence proceedings against the prospective defendant, and(b)the prospective defendant may have or have had possession of a document or thing that can assist in determining whether or not the applicant is entitled to make such a claim for relief, and(c)inspection of such a document would assist the applicant to make the decision concerned,the court may order that the prospective defendant must give discovery to the applicant of all documents that are or have been in the person's possession and that relate to the question of whether or not the applicant is entitled to make a claim for relief.InO'Connor v O'Connor[2018] NSWCA 214 at [21], Simpson AJA (McColl and Macfarlan JJA agreeing) set out the fivematterswhich the applicant for an order under r 5.3(1) must demonstrate(original emphasis):(1)the applicantmay beentitled to make a claim for relief from the court against the prospective defendant;(2)the applicant has made reasonable enquiries to obtain sufficient information to decide whether or not to commence proceedings;(3)having made reasonable enquiries, the applicant is unable to obtain sufficient information to make the decision whether or not to commence proceedings;(4)the prospective defendant may have or have had possession of a document or thing that could assist in determining whether the applicant is entitled to make a claim for relief; and(5)inspection of such a document would assist the applicant to make the decision whether or not to commence proceedings.In addition, as in the case of r 5.2, theCourt retains a discretion whether or not to order the defendant to provide discovery of the documents in question, which is to be exercised judicially and with regard to the case management provisions of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW)and the UCPR.InMuscat v Qin[2024] NSWSC 113 at [21]-[22],McGrath J summarised the relevant principles to be applied in determining whether to make an order under r 5.3,which I gratefully adopt. I will deal with each of the relevant matters inturn, bearing in mind that the proceedings which the plaintiffs are considering bringing againstMrPress are for his knowing involvement in a breach by the unidentified defendants of s 18 of the ACL by supplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs’pricing information or symbols.Whether theplaintiffsmay be entitled to make a claim for relief from the Court against the defendants?The word‘may’indicates that this requirement has a relatively low threshold and the Court does not have to reach a firm view that there is a right to relief or that there is a prima facie case. However, more thanamere assertion or suspicion is required:Hatfieldv TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd(2010) 77 NSWLR 506; [2010] NSWCA69at [47]-[49].In my view, the plaintiffs may be entitled to make a claim againstMrPress for knowing involvement in a breach of s 18of the ACLby the entities which used iSAM’s product pricing and symbols under the name PTX, at least where the symbol IDX is used because there isevidencethat this is distinctive of iSAM’s business. In my view, there is a prima facie case of involvement in such conduct byMrPress, given the broad definition of‘involved’in s 2 of the ACL, which extends toaperson who has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowinglyconcerned in, or party to, the contravention. This requires that the person involved has some knowledge of the essential facts whichgive riseto the contravention of s 18:Yorkev Lucas(1985) 158 CLR 661 at 670. It is likely thatMrPress will have knowledge of the conduct of the entities which used the PTX business name given his close association with thecompanywhich hasregisteredthat name, and the fact that thereisevidencethat PTX ceased touse iSAM’sIDXsymbolsoon afterMrPress received the H&L letter dated 24April 2024.Whether the plaintiffs have made reasonable enquiries to obtain sufficient information to decide whether or not to commence proceedings?For the reasons already given in relation to the order sought under r 5.2, in my view this requirement is met.Whether, having made reasonable enquiries, the plaintiffs are unable to obtain sufficient information to make the decision whether or not to commence proceedings?This requires an objective assessment of the information already possessed by the plaintiffs to determinewhetherthey are lacking something reasonably necessary to make a decision whether or not to commence proceedingsfor breach ofs 18 of the ACL againstthe unidentified defendants andMrPressfor knowing involvement in that breach. For example, an applicant may be entitled to preliminary discovery of documents relevant to available defences, or the extent of the apprehended breaches, or the likely quantum of damages as well as of documents which may establish whether there is a cause of action:Mortonv Nylex Ltd[2007] NSWSC 562 at [33]. However, preliminary discovery cannot be used to build up a case which the applicant plaintiffs have already decided, or could decide, to bring:Mortonat [33].Thedefendantssubmitted that it is clear that theplaintiffshave already decided, or could decide, to bring proceedings againstMrPressandconsequently do notsatisfythis requirement. Reliance is placed on three letters sent byH&Lin April and May 2024 toMrPress, which I have referred to earlier.Having carefully considered that correspondence, Ireject this submission.First,the H&Lcorrespondence does not indicate that the plaintiffs have already decided to commence proceedings either in England or in Australiaagainst the defendants.The reference in the first H&L letter to thePracticeDirectionmakes clear thatthe purpose of that letter is to followaprocedure mandated by thePracticeDirection before making a decision to commence proceedings inEngland. The statement in the second H&L letter that‘leading counsel had been instructed, with a view to preparation of particulars of claim’does not indicate that a decision to commence proceedings has been made. Read in context, it is merely a statement that further steps are being taken in preparation for commencement of a proceeding should such a decision be made.While the language in the H&L letters is quite strident in stating the allegation of wrongdoing by the defendants,eachof themindicates that the plaintiffs’‘investigation’of the facts is ongoing and the final H&L letter notes that‘much of the relevant material will be within your possession or control’which is clearly correct.Second,it is clear from the H&L letters that they concern a claim for breach of the Consultancy Agreement rather than s 18 of the ACL. The potential for a claim under s 18 of the ACL is the subject of the letters from Corrs to the defendants and it is clear from the Corrs letters that no decisionhasbeen madeby the plaintiffsto commence proceedings under s 18 of the ACL. Indeed, Corrs put the defendants on notice thatanapplication for preliminary discovery would be the next step.As noted earlier, the conduct alleged to be in breach of s 18 of the ACL was undertaken by different defendants and the claim will raise different issues to the claim of breach of the Consultancy Agreement.Third,while White J (as his Honour then was) observed inMortonat [33] that preliminary discovery cannot be used to build a case which the plaintiff on the information it hascouldbring, themere fact that a plaintiff has sufficient information to plead a claim does not mean that it has sufficient information to bring proceedings:Racing New South Wales v Racing Victoria (No 2)[2023] NSWSC 576 at [56]. It is clear fromMrJohnson’s evidence that the plaintiffs do not know the extent to which the unidentified defendants have used iSAM’sPricing in conjunction with its symbols or indeed whether it wasusingdifferent pricing. These are both material matters for a decision whether or not to commence proceedings againstMrPress for knowing involvement in a breach of s 18 by theunidentifieddefendants.Further information on these matters will be relevant to the extent of the apprehended breaches and the likelyquantumof damages, both of which are important (particularly on the factspresently known to the plaintiffs) to the decision whether to commence proceedings.While the H&L letter of 24 April 2024 alleges that theplaintiffs’loss from the allegedbreaches of the Consultancy Agreementis substantial,andestimated to be $1,083,000, this is clearly stated to be on a provisional and estimated basis.Fourth, the defendants’contention is that the Consultancy Agreement was terminated by notice given by the defendants on 1August2023. On that basis, the restraint period under the Consultancy Agreement terminated on 1 February 2024. Accordingly, the conductafter that timewhich the plaintiffs allegeisin breach of s 18, including in April 2024, would notbe part of aclaim brought in proceedings inthe United Kingdombut rather proceedings brought in Australiafor infringements ofs 18 of the ACL.For these reasons, I reject the submission that the correspondence by H&L with the defendants indicates that the decision to bring proceedings against thedefendantshasalready been made. Nor in my view can it be said that the application for preliminary discovery is brought to build up a case which the plaintiffs could decide to bringon the basis of the information already held.Whether the defendantsmay have or have had possession of documents that could assist in determining whether the plaintiffs are entitled to make a claim for relief?There does not appear to be any dispute that this requirement is satisfied.Whether inspection of such a document would assist theplaintiffsto make the decision whether or not to commence proceedings?The plaintiffs say that the documents soughtby prayer 9 of the amended summonswill provide information as to the following matters, each of which is relevant to a decisionas towhether to commence proceedings againstMrPress: (a)MrPress’role in the misuse of the plaintiffs’product pricing information and symbols; (b) the nature and extent ofMrPress’involvement in the PTX business; (c) the duration and extent of the misuse of the plaintiffs’pricing information and symbols generally; (d) whether the misuse of the plaintiffs’pricing information and symbols is ongoing; (e) the number of potentialretail brokers exposed to the misleading or deceptive conduct; and (f) the extent of damage caused by the misleading or deceptive conduct.The plaintiffs submit that this information is relevant to the plaintiffs’decision on whether to commence proceedings against the defendants, in particularMrPress, for beingknowinglyinvolved in a breach of s 18 of the ACLby the unidentified defendants. I acceptthesesubmissions.Whether it is appropriate in the exercise of the Court’s discretion to make an order under r 5.3?Finally, it is necessary to consider whether it is appropriate in the exercise of the Court’s discretion to make an order under r 5.3 for discovery of the documents soughtunder prayer 9. The defendants submit that if(contrary to their primary submission)an order is to be made, the scope of the documents sought is too wide, in particular the period chosen is too long, the use of the expression‘relating to’(rather than evidencing or recording) is too vague andthe category should belimited to pricing information whichutilisesthesymbol‘IDX’.Without conceding that the defendants’submission was correct, the plaintiffs provided to the Court after the hearing a revised version of prayer 9 as a fallback position:9.An order pursuant to rule 5.3(1) of the UCPR or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court that within 7 days of the date of this order, the Defendants give discovery(verified in accordance with rule 21.4 of the UCPR)to the Plaintiffs, of all documents in the Defendants’ possession created, dated or received during the period[1 June* or 1 August**]2023todateevidencingorrecordingthesupply,receiptoruseoftheplaintiffs’productpricinginformationor symbols, includingbut notlimited to price feed informationwith the prefix “IDX”.I accept the force of each of the pointsmade by the defendants. The revised form of the proposed order provided by the plaintiffs seeks to address the first two points.The relevant periodis reducedto a period commencing on either 1June 2023 (being the month in which the PTX Markets business name was registered,being19 June 2023)or 1 August 2023 (the date on which thedefendants say they gave notice terminating the Consultancy Agreement)and ending onthe date on which the order is made by the Court.In my view, the appropriate period for discovery is 1June 2023 to the date of the order, because thisfocuses attention onthe likely period(on the evidence)in which the business using the name PTX Marketswasconductedand avoids imposing an unnecessary burden(in relation to time and costs of compliance)on the defendants.In my view, it is appropriate to replace‘relating to’with‘evidencing or recording’so that the nature of the documents sought is clear and not ambiguous.Also,for the reasons already given, in my viewthe scope of the discovery should be limited to pricing information relating to the use of that symbol‘IDX’.CostsThere is a question as to who should bear the costs of the discovery and ofthisproceeding.The parties did not address the question of costs at the hearing, no doubt because itwouldbe influenced by the outcome ofthisproceeding. I will make orders for a timetable allowing the parties to make submissions on costs.ConclusionFor the above reasons the Court will make the following orders:An order that by16September 2024 thefirstdefendant should swear or affirm and serve on the plaintiffs an affidavit setting out the full name and address of the person or personswhoin the period 1 June 2023 to the date of this order:offered, supplied or made available liquidity and/or brokerage services, includingbut notlimitedto,theprovision ofpricinginformationwithrespectto financial products or financial services,under the business name‘PTX Markets’or through the website URL: ptxmarkets.com.supplied, received or used the plaintiffs’product pricing information or symbolswiththeprefix‘IDX’.Anorderpursuanttorule5.2(2)(b)oftheUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR)that by 16 September 2024, thedefendants give discovery (verified in accordance with rule 21.4 of the UCPR) to theplaintiffs, of:all documents in thedefendants’possession created, dated or received duringtheperiod1June 2023to the date of this order,revealing the identity of the personorpersonsoffering, supplying or making available liquidity and/or brokerage services, including but not limited to, the provision of pricing information withrespect tofinancial products or financial services, under the business name‘PTX Markets’or through the website URL: ptxmarkets.com.all documents in thedefendants’possession created, dated or received duringtheperiod1June 2023tothe date of this order revealing the identity of the personorpersonssupplying, receiving or using the plaintiffs’product pricing information which utilises a symbol with the prefix‘IDX’.An order pursuant to rule 5.3(1) of the UCPR that by 16 September 2024, thedefendants give discovery (verified in accordance with rule 21.4 of the UCPR)to theplaintiffs, of all documents in thedefendants’possession created, dated or received during the period1June2023tothedateof this orderevidencingorrecordingthesupply,receiptoruseoftheplaintiffs’productpricinginformationwhich utilises asymbol with the prefix‘IDX’.Direct the parties tobring in short minutes of order for the making ofsubmissions on costs within7days.Note that thecostsorderswill be made, if possible,on the papersbut that if any of the parties requires a brief oral hearing this should be identified in the submissions filed pursuant to theshort minutes referred to in order 4(with a short explanation as to why an oral hearing is necessary).Liberty to apply on 2 days’ notice.**********Amendments22 August 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t22 August 2024 - Party names updated.22 August 2024 - Typographical error at [69] corrected, \"HWL\" replaced with \"Corrs\".DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The second and third defendants filed submitting appearances.In these reasons, I will refer to the first defendant as the defendant.The plaintiff seeks ordersinter aliain the nature of certiorari and mandamus.The defendant(who wasthe claimant in the PIC), Duc Thuong Le, was injured in a motor vehicle accident(“the accident”)on 7 October 2018. The plaintiff is the CTP insurer of the vehicle at fault in the accident.The defendantclaimed that he had sustaineda number ofinjuries as a result of the accident. He lodged a claim for statutory benefits with theplaintiff.As will be seen, the focal point of the plaintiff’s claim for relief is the head injury which formed part of Mr Le’s claim.The plaintiff had submitted to theMedicalAssessor and thereview panelthat the head injury was not caused by the accidentbut had been caused by the defendant’s conduct in beating his head against the ground. However, thereview panelin its decision on 24 August 2023found that the accident was a morethan negligible cause of the head injury.Thereview paneldetermined at [193]:The following injury was caused by the motor accident and is not a threshold injury:Head–mild traumaticbraininjury.Thereview panelhad made other findings at [192], which are not challenged inthe present proceedings:The following injuries were caused by the motor accident and are threshold injuries:Cervical spine–soft tissueinjury;Lumbar spine–soft tissueinjury;Right shoulder–soft tissue injury; andAbdomen–soft tissue injury.Grounds of reviewThe grounds of review are:Ground 1: The review panel was required to determine the question of causation in accordance with clauses 6.5 – 6.7 of theMotor AccidentGuidelines…, theCivil Liability Act2002and common law principles. The review panel erred in determining causation as follows:(a)The review panel reversed the onus of proof and/or otherwise did not apply the correct principles regarding onus of proof in relation to causation.(b)The review panel failed to approach the determination of causation as required by clauses 6.5 – 67 [sic]of the guidelines, section 5D of theCivil Liability Act 2002, and common law principles.(c)In particular, thereview panel erred in finding that that [sic] the claimant’s post-accident agitation was caused by the accident merely because there was no evidence of pre-accident agitation, in circumstances where it was accepted that the claimant was under the effect of stimulant drugs.(d)The review panel’s approach to causation reveals errorin the nature of apost hoc ergo propter hocfallacy.These errors constitutejurisdictionalerror and error of law on the face of the record.Ground 2: The review panel was required to provide reasons for its decision, pursuant to section 7.23(7) of the[Motor Accident Injuries]Act. The review panel failed to expose its actual path of reasoning in the following respects:(a)Failing to explain how the claimant sustained a brain injury in the subject motor accident.(b)Failing to explain what “impact of the accident” was said to have caused the agitation that the review panel determined was caused by the accident.(c)Failing to explain why the accident caused the said brain injury.(d)Failing to explain whether theclaimant sustained a brain injury in the motor accident or in the subsequent beating of his head on the ground (or combination of the two).(e)Referring to the presence of seizure activity to support the finding of existence of brain injury caused by the accident, in circumstances where the review panel also said that the accident was not a contributing factor to any seizure.These are errors of law on the face of the record.Ground 3: Making a finding that there was a head injury and traumatic brain injury sustained in the motor accident, when there was no evidence to support that finding. This was a jurisdictional error.Ground 4:Failing to respond to a substantial and clearly articulated argument made by the insurer, based on established facts, regarding the cause of the claimant’s claimed head injury and brain injury. This was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction and a denial of procedural fairness.In oral submissions in this Court, Ms Gumbert, counsel for the plaintiff,confirmed that the principal issue in the present application was thereviewpanel’s findingsas tothe cause of the head injury. Ms Gumbert said that the relief sought in the groundsseeking reliefencompassed“the whole of the decision merely because it was not practicable to carve up a decision and send parts back”.[1]BackgroundfactsThe accident occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning, 7 October 2018. The vehicle in whichthe defendantwas travelling as a rear seat driver’s side passenger collided with the rear of a vehicle travelling in the same direction, then mounted the footpath and collided with a tree. It is accepted by the plaintiff that the vehicle had been travelling at about 100 kilometres per hour before the collision.A witness reported to police that he heard a person banging on the car window trying to get out. The witness smashed the passenger side front window and the person crawled out through that smashed window. That person was the defendant. The witness reported that the defendant was holding his shoulder in pain. His behaviour waserraticand he may have been intoxicated. He became aggressive and was yelling.A police officer, Constable Giblin, went to the scene of the accident.He reported that the defendant was standing in the middle of the road and behaving erratically. He refused to get off the road even though cars were passing close by. Constable Giblin pulled him off the road at which pointthe defendantstarted kicking and thrashing and trying to push the police officer away. When the defendant was restrained on the ground, he started beating his head on the ground forcefully and repeatedly, at least a dozen times.Constable Giblin believed that the defendant was drug affected. The police officer did not believe that the defendant had any head injuries that he could see prior to the defendant beating his head on the ground. He considered that given the force with which the defendant was hitting his head on the ground, the injuries thathesaw were sustained during the hitting of the head on the ground.The defendant was taken by ambulance to hospital. Urine tests conducted in the hospital confirmed that the defendant had consumed illicit drugs, including benzodiazepines,cocaineand amphetamines prior to the accident.The proceedings belowIn the PIC,the defendantclaimed that he had suffered multiple injuriesas a result ofthe accident. There was a dispute betweenthe defendantand theplaintiffas to the medical assessment matter set out in sch 2 cl 2(e) of theMotor Accident Injuries Act 2017(NSW)(“theAct”), namely whether the injury caused by the accident was a“threshold injury”for the purposes of the Act.From 1 April 2023 the Act provides that a“minor injury”is known as a“threshold injury”.A“threshold injury”is defined in s 1.6 of the Act asincludinga soft tissue injury. The plaintiff does not dispute that an injury to the brain is not a threshold injury.Theplaintiffdisputed that any of the injuries were non-threshold injuries and,as stated above at [4],disputed that any head or brain injury was caused by the accident as opposed to having been caused by thedefendant’sown conduct following the accident.The assessment by the Medical AssessorThedefendantwas assessed by Medical Assessor Cameron on behalf of the PIC, who determined on 28 August 2022 thatall ofthe claimed physical injuries were minor injuries, but the head and traumatic brain injury was a non-minor injury caused by the accident.Heissued a certificate in which he concluded the following injuries were a minor injury:Cervical spine–soft tissue injuryRight shoulder–soft tissue injuryAbdomen–soft tissue injuryLumbar spine–soft tissue injuryTheMedicalAssessor concluded that the following injury was not a minor injury:Head–mild traumatic brain injuryIn his reasons, the Medical Assessor stated that the mild traumatic brain injury was not a“minor”injury because there had been documented abnormalities of brain function and thus there had been an injury to the organ that is the brain.The Medical Assessor had earlier reviewed and summarised relevant documentation. His summary included the following:The ambulance form confirms the incident on 7 October 2018. It noted there had been ahigh speedmotor vehicle crash. Police officers were restraining Mr Le. He was agitated and unco-operative. The airbags were deployed and there was significant damage to the vehicle. Sedation was given. The initial Glasgow Coma Score was 12 and became 3 after administration ofDroperidol.The Medical Assessor’s conclusions included the following:In the motor vehicle crash on 7 October 2018, Mr Le sustained a mild traumatic brain injury and musculoskeletal injuries.There is clear documentation from the ambulance form and from the treating clinicians at St Vincent’s Hospital that there was a brain injury and seizures occurred. There was a significant disturbancein level of conscious [sic] and post traumatic amnesia occurred. That is not a minor injury.…Causation is established based on the information provided by Mr Le and the clinical records, particularly the ambulance report and the St Vincent’s Hospital discharge summary.…The following injuries WERE caused by the motor accident:Head–mild traumatic brain injuryCervical spine–soft tissue injuryRight shoulder–soft tissue injuryAbdomen–soft tissue injuryLumbar spine–soft tissue injuryThe review panel’sdecisionand statement of reasonsTheplaintiffapplied for review oftheMedical Assessor’sdecision, pursuant to s 7.26 of the Act, claiming that the assessor had failed to have regard to thedefendant’spost-accident conduct, and that the assessor failed to give proper reasons.Thereview panelpublished detailed reasons for its decision.Thereview panelfirst set out the relevant statutory provisions,andalsoat [16]noted the test for causation of injuries, as discussedby Wright JinBriggs v IAG Limited trading as NRMA Insurance[2022] NSWSC 372at [35](“Briggs”).Thereview panelthenreferred totheMedical Assessor’scertificateat [17]-[27]. In recountingthe review procedureat [28]-[34], thereview panelnoted that“the review is by way of a new assessment of all matters with which the medical assessment is concerned”.Thereview panelsummarised the evidence before it, which included police and ambulance records, hospital admission records,the report of Dr Tischdated 16 November 2018 and other treating medical records.Thereview panelreproducedat [38] thepolice report Event Ref NO E69832865whichrecords the following:At about 3.20am on Sunday, 7 October 2018 VEH 2 was travelling southbound in lane 4 of 5 on York St, Sydney.When VEH 2 was passing the intersection of York St and Jamison St, VEH 1 which was also travelling southbound on York St, behind VEH 2, collided with the rear of VEH 2 and then mounted the western sidewalk of York St and collided with a tree approximately 10 metres south of Jamison St. As a result of the collision, the vehicle received the above listed damage. It is currently unclear how the front of VEH 2 was damaged.DRIVER 1 and another passenger fled from the scene, running westbound in Jamison St. One passenger remained in the vehicle.The collision was witnessed by WIT 1 and WIT 2. WIT 1, who was concerned for the welfare of the passenger, broke the front passenger side window of VEH 1, which the passenger climbed out of. Both vehicles were then towed from the scene.Thereview panelquoted at [40] the record of interview which Constable Giblin provided to an investigator retained by the plaintiff which included thefollowingstatement of a witness at the scene:I ran to the scene and went up to the grey car. I heard a person banging on the window who appeared to be trying to get out of the vehicle. I tried yanking open thedoorbut it would not open. I heard a hissing sound coming from the bonnet area of the vehicle and thought the car might explode or catch onfireso I smashed the passenger side front window. An Asian male wearing a grey hoodie and red shoes crawled out through the smashed window. The male was holding his shoulder in pain. He was saying, “I love my girlfriend so much” and appeared to have erratic behaviour and was mumbling other random sentences. I believe this male may have been intoxicated. … I turned around and could see that the male from the grey car was inside the driver’s seat of the white car and possibly trying to drive away. The door wasopenand I could see him playing around with the gear stick. The male got out and ran to the middle road [sic] and was walking in circles and became aggressive, yelling.At [41]-[44] of thereview panel’sdecision,furtherparts of Constable Giblin’s account given to the insurance investigatorwerereproduced, including the following:… [thedefendant] was standing in the middle of the road and witnesses identified him. We were also told that people were brawling which wasn’t in fact thecasebut it was quite a chaotic scene at the time. We asked him to get off … we said, “Come onto the footpath”. He was behaving erratically. Said, “No” while cars would be driving quite close to him. So, I led him by his left side totry and get him onto the road and he shrugged me off. So, I pulled him onto the road. He said, “Is that all you’ve got?” and, started kicking and thrashing and trying to push away. So, we restrained him on the ground at which point he started beating his head onto the ground saying, “Let me help you. Let me help you.” Quite forcefully and repeatedly. A bystander then held his head to the ground, however he – to prevent him from beating his head on the ground. However, he continued to do so. ……it all happened so quickly when wearrivedbut I don’t believe he had any head injuries that I could see prior to him beating his head on the ground. He had to be heavily sedated by paramedics, so I believed that he was drug affected at the time as well. His eyes were rolling into the back of his head. He was frothing at the mouth. I was very worried for him, so were the ambos.…given the force that he was hitting his head on the ground I would say that the injury that I saw was sustained during that because he – it was done repeatedly at least a dozen times.Thereview panelreproduced the ambulance reportat [45] which included:C/T 29 YOM high speedMVA Police state based on damage possibly travelling 100+ km/hr. O/A 3x police officers holding Pt prone to ground. Pt highly agitated, uncooperative, foaming at the mouth? Drug affected? … Either driver or back seat passenger of vehicle airbagsdeployed and significant damage to vehicle. Difficulty with initial assessment due to Pt positioning and agitation. Pt given 10mgDroperidolwith good effect … H2T – Haematoma and bleeding to R forehead, seatbelt trauma/bruising …Thereview panelstated at [46] that“Droperidolis a butyrophenone used in acute care settings for a variety of purposes, including the rapid sedation of patients with agitation, aggression or who are exhibiting violent behaviour…”.Thereview panelrecounted theplaintiff’s submissionsat [84]-[95], which includedthat“Medical Assessor Cameron was not aware that by the time the ambulance arrived the claimant was restrained against the ground and had repeatedly struck his head against the floor out of his own volition”: at [88]. Theplaintiffsubmittedthat Medical Assessor Cameron“failed to address any of the evidence of the claimant’s self-inflicted head trauma”, therefore“it is necessary to determine whether the claimant solely suffered a brain injury in the accident, whether he solely suffered a brain injury due to the self-inflicted head strikes or whether there was a brain injury in the crash as well as self-inflicted head strikes”: [89] and [91].Thereview panelreferred to the plaintiff’s specific submissions as to causation at (1)-(10) of [92]. In (6), the plaintiff had submitted:There is no evidence of seizures until at least after the self-inflicted head-strikes. Based on the Ambulance report, the seizure like activity occurred only after the administration ofDroperidolas the seizure like activity occurredenroute to the Hospital and required the removal of the C-Collar.Thereview panelnoted at [94] that theplaintiffsubmittedthat“there is no evidence to suggest that the claimant’s head was impacted during the collision”, that he was a rear passenger wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision, and that Constable Giblin did not note any signs of head injuries prior to his self-inflicted head strikes.Thereview panelstated at [95]that the plaintiff“submits the head injury and related symptoms was [sic] not causally related to the accident but was self-inflicted by the [defendant]”.After detailing the defendant’s submissions, thereview panelreferred to the defendant’s assessment by Medical Assessor Tai-Tak Wan on 17 July 2023, his personal and social history and the“[h]istoryof the accident”. At [115]-[116], thereview panelrecounted whatwassaid by the defendant to Medical Assessor Wan.Paragraph[116] is as follows:When asked what he last remembered before he lost consciousness, [the defendant]refused to give any answer. When asked to nominate the first thing he could remember after he regained consciousness, he again refused to give him an answer, but agreed that he woke up in the hospital and found nurses helping him. He said he was not the driver, but he could not remember who the driver was. He admitted he might have taken some drugs that night, but he could not give further details.Thereview panelreferred tothe defendant’s mental state screening test and considered that he did not give his best effort indoingthe test. Thereview panelconsidered that, whilst hisabstract thinking and executive function were impaired, it was“most likely due to inadequate effort or the existence of a psychological condition, such as severe depression, as the pattern of difficulties is different from what would be expected in a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury”: [140].In relation to the claimed head injury, thereview panelconcluded (at [167]-[168]):There is no evidence of a moderate or severe head injury. The MRI brain, CT brain scan and CT angiography were all normal … There was unspecific duration of loss of consciousness reported, but when police saw him, he was conscious although he appeared to be confused or agitated. However, there was evidence the claimant had taken benzodiazepine,cocaineand cannabis (urine test) and probably also alcohol, noting the ambulance reported the smell of alcohol so that presentation may have been drug related.However, the panel is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that Mr Le sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) noting the GCS and the seizure activity observed but also considering the normal CT scan, MRI scan, and short PTA duration.After noting that there was a dispute as to causation of the closed head injury, thereview panel, having regard to the comments of Wright JBriggs, considered it was appropriate to apply the test of causation set out in Part 6 of the Guidelines.Thereview panelstated at [170] that inBriggs“Wright J also remindedusthe relevant legal test in relation to causation does not require scientific certainty”. Thereview panelcited what was said by his Honour at[70]-[72].Inconcluding thatthe accident did materially contribute to the traumatic brain injury, thereview panelsaid:[171]The Panel notes not only was the claimant involved in the accident, but he was also under the influence of drugs and following the accident was seen to repeatedly strike his head upon the ground. The Panel refers to the opinion of Dr Tisch who concluded several factors contributed to the seizures, namely the likelihood of a closed head injury arising from the accident and the effects of the stimulant drugs. However, although Dr Tisch was aware that Mr Le was agitated and uncooperative at the scene, he was apparently unaware he had struck his head repeatedly on the ground.[172]It is clear fromBriggsthat the principles of causation of injury set out on Part 6 of the Guidelines as they apply to permanent impairment also apply to the assessment of threshold injury. The question, therefore, to be considered is whether the traumatic brain injury was caused or materially contributed to by the accident. It is also noted the accident does not have to be the sole causeas long asit is a contributing cause which is more than negligible.[173]Considering the accident occurred at high speed, estimated to be 100kmph and Mr Le had to extricate himself from the vehicle through a window with the help of a bystander the Panel is satisfied that the accident was a more than negligible cause of the head injury. Further, where there is no evidence to establish, notwithstanding the presence of drugs in his body, that he was agitated prior to the accident,the Panel finds the claimant’s agitation and conduct in striking his head on the ground was due to the impact of the accident in addition to the presence of stimulant drugs in his body.The Panel finds on the balance of probabilities that the accident contributed to the claimant’s agitation following the accident. The Panel is satisfied, on the balance ofprobabilities, the accident materially contributed to the TBI, in that it was a contributing cause which was more than negligible.Thereview panelwent on to say at [174] that it was less confident about the seizure. Thereview panelstated that it had some doubt as to whether the defendant“even suffered a seizure”. Thereview panelnoted that the seizure“reportedly occurred when the [defendant] was being transported to hospital. However, when the [defendant]was assessed by a neurologist at the hospital no signs of seizure activity were apparent”.Thereview panelstated at [176]-[177]:Even if the[defendant]had sustained a seizure the Panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities the accident was a contributing factor. The Panel believes any seizure, if it occurred, was most likely drug related, probably due to the adverse effects ofDroperidolas it is well known to cause dystonic reaction, uncontrolled repetitive body movements, stiffness, spasm, shaking, loss of balance and even seizure, or due to drug withdrawal, given it is clear from the hospital records the claimant was under the influence of drugs.However, the Panel, after consideringand balancing the possibilities, finds the accident was a contributing factor which was more than negligible to the head injury-mild traumatic brain injury. A traumatic brain injury is not a threshold injury as it affected the brain, therefore the head injury, even if it is mild, is not a threshold injury.Relevantlegislative provisionsCivil Liability Act 2002(NSW):5D General principles(1) A determination that negligence causedparticular harmcomprises the following elements—(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and(b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).(2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things)whether or notand why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.(3) If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to determine what the person who suffered harm would have done if the negligent person had not been negligent—(a) the matter is to be determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances, subject to paragraph (b), and(b) any statement made by the person after suffering the harm about what he or she would have done is inadmissible except to the extent (if any) that the statement is against his or her interest.(4) For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things)whether or notand why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.5E Onus of proofIn proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation.Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017(NSW):7.23 Status of medical assessments(cfs 61 MACA)(1) The medical assessor or assessors to whom a medical dispute is referred

the original certificate for the medical assessment for which the review is sought, or(b) a longer period determined or allowed, whether generally or for the kind of proceedings, in accordance with the Commission rules.State Insurance Regulatory Authority – Motor Accident Guidelines:6.5 An assessment of the degree of permanent impairment is a medical assessment matter under clause 2(a) of Schedule 2 of the Act. The assessment must determine the degree of permanent impairment of the injured personas a result ofthe injury caused by the motor accident. A determination as to whether the injured person's impairment is related to the accident in question is therefore implied in all such assessments. Medical assessors must be aware of the relevant provisions of the AMA4 Guides, as well as the common law principles that would be applied by a court (or the Personal Injury Commission) in considering such issues.6.6 Causation is defined in the Glossary at page 316 of the AMA4 Guides as follows:'Causation means that a physical,chemicalor biologic factor contributed to the occurrence of a medical condition. To decide that a factor alleged to have caused or contributed to the occurrence or worsening of a medical condition has, in fact, done so, it is necessary to verify both of the following:The alleged factor could have caused or contributed to worsening of the impairment, which is a medical determination.The alleged factor did cause or contribute to worsening of the impairment, which is a non-medical determination.'This, therefore, involves a medical decision and a non-medical informed judgement.6.7 There is no simple common test of causation that is applicable to all cases, but the accepted approach involves determining whether the injury (and the associated impairment) was caused or materially contributed to by the motor accident. The motor accident does not have to be a sole causeas long asit is a contributing cause, which is more than negligible. Considering the question 'Would this injury (or impairment) have occurred if not for the accident?' may be useful in some cases, although this is not a definitive test and may be inapplicable in circumstances where there are multiple contributing causes.A summary of the grounds of reviewThe plaintiff raises four grounds of review in relation to the decision of the review panel. Those errors,shortly stated, are said to be: firstly, that the review panel reversed the onus of proof; secondly (which is part of the first ground of appeal),the review panel failed to apply the lawfultestof causation; thirdly,that the review panel“failed to expose its actual path of reasoning”(ground 2); fourthly,the review panelmade a finding when there was no evidence to support that finding (ground 3);and fifthly,the review panel“failed to respond to a substantial and clearly articulated argument”(ground 4).In oral submissions, Ms Gumbert accepted that the first 160 paragraphsof the review panel’s statement of reasonswere“by and large”very good butsubmitted that the review panel had fallen at the“last hurdle”which was when it came to“actually making”the decision with respect to causation.[2]Ground 1: the review panel reversed the onus of proof; the review panel failed to apply the lawful test ofcausationThe plaintiff’s complaint of the reversal of the onus of proof focuses on [173] of the review panel’s reasons in which the following appears:Further, where there is no evidence to establish, notwithstanding the presence of drugs in his body, that he was agitated prior to the accident, thePanel finds the claimant’s agitation and conduct in striking his head on the ground was due to the impact of the accident in addition to the presence of stimulant drugs in his body.The plaintiff contended that the review panel incorrectly reversed the onus of proof by relying onthefindingthat“there is no evidencetoestablish”that the plaintiff was agitated prior to the accident as forming the basis for the conclusion thatthe agitation and head-striking was caused by the accident.The plaintiff citedAllianz Australia Insurance Limited v Mackenzie &Ors[2014] NSWSC 67(“Allianz Australia”)in which the plaintiff submitted a similar error occurred.The plaintiff contended that the review panel failed to apply the lawful test of causation in accordance with Part 6 of theMotorAccidentGuidelines,reproduced at[39]above(“the Guidelines”). The plaintiff submitted that the review panel was also required to conduct the assessment of causation in accordance with ss 5D and 5E of theCivil Liability Act(reproduced at[37]above).Mr Romaniuk,SeniorCounsel for the defendant, submitted that the review panel was clearly aware of the test of causation explained by Wright J inBriggs. He submitted that the review panel’s reasoning was“perfectly acceptable”:there was no reversal of onus and the paragraph in the reasoning was“a statement of the evidence before them”.[3]ConsiderationThe review panel was plainly aware of how the question of causation of injuries was to be determined. The review panel quoted at [16] what was stated by Wright J inBriggsat [35]. Furthermore, after referring to the dispute as to causation of the closed head injury at [169], the review panel had“regard to the comments of Wright J inBriggs”and considered it was appropriate“to apply the test as to causation set out in Part 6 of the Guidelines”. When referring once again toBriggsat [170], the review panelstated that itwas reminded by Wright J“that the relevant legal test in relation to causation does not require certainty.”The review panel then quotedwhat was said by Wright J in [70]-[72].Prior to referring to the absence of evidence to establish agitationin [173], the review panelsaid in the same paragraph:Considering the accident occurred at high speed, estimated to be 100kmph and[the defendant]had to extricate himself from the vehicle through a window with the help of a bystander the Panel is satisfied that the accident was a more than negligible cause of the head injury.The decision inAllianz Australiadoes not assist the plaintiff. In that case, Hoeben CJ at CL drew a distinction between the approach of the review panel in relation to the right shoulder injury and to the low back injury. In relationto the right shoulder injury, his Honour concluded at [36] that the onus of proof had been reversed but that was not the case in respect of the low back injury. His Honour said at [38]-[39]:This is not so in relation to the low back injury. The Review Panel's initial finding (which was open to it) was that there was \"sufficient contemporaneous evidence\" supporting a causal connection between the injury to the low back and the motor accident. The Review Panel confirmed this positive finding when it had regard to the pre-existing degenerative changes but disregarded them. It was only after that positive finding had been made that the Review Panel considered whether there was evidence of any other significant contributing causes.That approach does not reverse the onus of proof and is an acceptable mode of reasoning towards a causation finding.It is consistent with the MAA Permanent Impairment Guidelines and the Common Law as to causation. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not made out its causation challenge to the Review Panel’s finding in relation to the low back.In the present case, the review panel’sinitial finding was that the accident occurred at a high speed estimated to be 100km/h and the defendant having to extricate himself through a window supported a causal connection between the head injury and the accident. It was only after the review panel made this finding that the review panel referred to the absence of evidence of the defendant being agitated prior to the accident.When the review panel referred to the absence of evidence, the review panel was making a statement of the available evidence before it. The review panel did not reverse the onus of proof.In written submissions in reply, the plaintiff raisedInsurance Australia Limited trading as NRMA Insurance vTrkulija[2023] NSWSC 956 as another decision which was said to support the contention that the onus of proof had been reversed. In that case, the review panel’s reasons considered by Chen J at [77] and [84] were very different to the present case and do not assist the plaintiff’s contention.The plaintiff has not established ground 1.Ground 2: the review panel failed to expose its actual path ofreasoningThe plaintiff submitted that the review panel failed to expose its path of reasoning in relation to critical aspects of how it came to determine the causation of the injury, which included how the defendant sustaineda brain injury in the accident.The plaintiff contended that it was not possible to discern how or why the review panelconcluded thatthe defendant sustained a traumatic brain injuryas a result ofthe accident. The plaintiff complained that the actual path of reasoningwasnot exposed and there were unexplained gaps in the reasoning which could not be filled by necessary inference. The plaintiff submitted that the failure to disclose the path of reasoning was an error of law on the face of the record.Ms Gumbert referred to inconsistent reasoning by the review panel at [168] and at [176].Ms Gumbertsubmitted that at [168] the review panel was satisfied thatthe defendant had sustained a mild traumatic brain injury“noting the GCS and the seizure activity”but later stated at [176] that if there was a seizure, the accident was not a contributing factor. The plaintiff contended that this was internally inconsistent reasoning, constituting error of law on the face of the record.The defendant submitted that thereview panel’s causation finding, as explained by it, represents an orthodox outcome of the application of factual causation. The defendant pointed out that his case was that he had been involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident that caused a head injury. On the facts of the collision, the defendant’s case was sustainable in a causal pathway determined on the balance of probabilities. It was the plaintiff which was advancing an alternative causal pathway. The defendant argued that the statementsat [173] reflect“the review panel exposing its reasoning to the deliberations of its path of reasons on the causation dispute between the parties”.[4]In oral submissions, Mr Romaniuk said there was no inconsistency between [168] and [174].He said that the review panel wasat [168]examining the defendant’s condition and complaints. This was said to be“the diagnosispointrather than the causation point”.[5]ConsiderationInWingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd vKocak(2013) 252 CLR 480; [2013] HCA 43 (“Wingfoot”), French CJ,Crennan, Bell,Gagelerand Keane JJ held at [47]:The function of a Medical Panel is to form and to give its own opinion on the medical question referred for its opinion. In performing that function, the Medical Panel is doubtless obliged to observe procedural fairness,so as togive an opportunity for parties to the underlying question or matter who will be affected by the opinion to supply the Medical Panel with material which may be relevant to the formation of the opinion and to make submissions to the Medical Panel on the basis of that material. The material supplied may include the opinions of other medical practitioners, and submissions to the Medical Panel may seekto persuade the Medical Panel to adopt reasoning or conclusions expressed in those opinions. The Medical Panel may choose in a particular case to place weight on a medical opinion supplied to it in forming and giving its own opinion. It goes too far, however, to conceive of the function of the Panel as being either to decide a dispute or to make up its mind by reference to competing contentions or competing medical opinions. The function of a Medical Panel is neither arbitral nor adjudicative: it is neither to choose between competing arguments, nor to opine on the correctness of other opinions on that medical question. The function is in every case to form and to give its own opinion on the medical question referred to it by applying its own medical experience and its own medical expertise. (Footnotes omitted.)The High Court said further at [55]:The standard required of a written statement of reasons given by a Medical Panel under s 68(2) of the Act can therefore be stated as follows. The statement of reasons must explain the actual path of reasoning by which the Medical Panel in fact arrived at the opinion the Medical Panel in fact formed on the medical question referred to it. The statement of reasons must explain that actual path of reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a court to see whether the opinion does or does not involve any error of law. If a statement of reasons meeting that standard discloses an error of law in the way the Medical Panel formed its opinion, the legal effect of the opinion can be removed by an orderin the nature of certiorarifor that error of law on the face of the record of the opinion. If a statement of reasons fails to meet that standard, that failure is itself an error of law on the face of the record of the opinion,on the basis ofwhich an order in the nature of certiorari can be made removing the legal effect of the opinion.As may be seen in the summary of the statement of reasons at [21]-[36], the review panel set out in considerable detailall ofthe evidence relating to the accident. The review panel’s reasons reveal astep-by-stepapproach to the task before it. The review panel was well-apprised of the plaintiff’s submissions as to a lack of a causal connection between the head injury and the accident. In reaching its decision, the review panel was entitled to have regard to the high speed at which the vehicle was travelling; that it collided with the rear of another vehicle; mounted the footpath;and collided with a tree. The review panel was also entitled to have regard to the defendant extricating himself from the vehicle which had been significantly damaged, and his state of agitation.In accordance with its function and the requirement inWingfootat [55], Iam of the opinion thatthe review panel’s reasons for its decision explains the path of its reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a court to see whether the opinion did or did not involve an error of law.The review panel was not required to explainhow it came to its decision by reference to the competing contentions of the parties:Wingfootat [47].There is no inconsistency in the review panel’s reasoning at [168] and [176].The review panel noted at [168]“the seizure activity observed”. The review panel was referring to the observations of an ambulance officer recorded in the ambulance report that“enroute to SVH[the patient]proceeded to have seizure like activity”. The review panel’s doubt at [174] as to whether the defendant“even suffered a seizure”and if he did was“not satisfied on the balance of probabilities the accident was not a contributing factor”did not mean the review panel could not take into account“the seizure activity observed”by the ambulance officer as a factor in reaching its conclusion on the balance of probabilities that the defendant sustained a mild traumatic brain injuryas a result of the accident.The plaintiff has not established ground 2.Ground 3: no evidence to support thefindingThe plaintiff submitted that the review paneldid not identify any evidence that could logically support a finding that the defendant sustained a head injury or traumatic brain injuryas a result ofthe accident. The plaintiff referred to its submissions to the review panel.The plaintiff citedInsurance Limited t/as NRMA v Richards[2023] NSWSC 909(“Richards”)andSwain v Waverly Municipal Council(2005) 220 CLR 577; [2005] HCA 4.The plaintiff submitted that making a finding that there was a traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident when there was no evidence to support that finding was a jurisdictional error.Mr Romaniuk referred to the factual aspects of the case which included the substantial impact of the vehicle with the tree. He pointed out that the police and ambulance officers did not attend the scene of the accident for some minutes after it had happened. By that point,Mr Romaniuksaid, the defendanthad been extricated from the vehicle because a witness had thought the vehicle might explode orburn,andwas found in an agitated state.ConsiderationIt is well-established that factual findings must be supported by logically probative evidence. InAustralian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond(1990) 170 CLR 321; [1990] HCA 33, Deane J said at 367:When the process of decision-making is disclosed, there will be a discernible breach of the duty if findings of fact upon which a decision is based are unsupported by probative material and if inferences of fact upon which such a decision is based cannot reasonably be drawn from such findings of fact. Breach of a duty to act judicially constitutes an error of law which will vitiate the decision.As Schmidt AJ observed inRichardsat [121]-[122], there must be a factual basis forfindingsand they cannot rest“simply on a consideration of possibilities”.The plaintiff correctly submitted the test is not whether there was any evidence at all, but rather whether there was no evidence that ought reasonably to satisfy the decision maker that the fact sought to be provedisestablished:Naxakisv Western General Hospital(1999) 197 CLR 269; [1999] HCA 22 per McHugh J at [39];Origin Energy LPG Ltd vBestcareFoods Ltd[2013] NSWCA 90 per Ward JA at [88]-[90].Before reaching its decision, the review panel was obliged to considerall ofthe evidence which included Constable Giblin’s statement of the defendant hitting his head on the ground which was done at least a dozen times andthattheConstable did not see any visible head injuries prior to that happening.There was also the evidence of the defendant wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision and being under the influence of drugs.The weight to be given to Constable Giblin’s statement was a matter for the review panel, which was not required to state what it made of that evidence:Wingfootat [47].The defendant was unable to give an account of the accident. He told Dr Tisch that he was a rear seat passengerbut did not disclose anything further about the accident.His diagnoses included amnesia.The review panel was plainly aware of all the evidence before it.The review panel based its findings that the accident was a contributing cause of the head injury which was more than negligible on:The accident occurring at high speed estimated to be 100km/h. There was evidence as I have previouslystated,that the vehicle collided with the rear of another vehicle, mounted the footpath and collided with a tree;The defendant had to extricate himself from the vehicle through a window with the help of a bystander. There was evidence that the defendant had been a passenger in the rear seat of the vehicle. The bystander heard the defendant banging on the window trying to get out of the damaged vehicle. The bystander smashed the passenger side front window through which the defendant crawled out. The bystander saw the defendant holding his shoulder in pain; andThere was no evidencethat, notwithstanding the presence of drugs, the defendant was agitated prior to the accident. The bystander referred to the defendant’s erratic behaviouras did Constable Giblin. Constable Giblin made mention of the defendant kicking and thrashing and trying to push him away. All of this occurred before the defendant beat his head on the ground.The review panel found that the defendant’s agitation and conduct in striking his head on the ground was due to the impact of the accident in addition to the presence of stimulant drugs in his body.Viewingtheevidence in combination, itwas reasonably open to the review panel to reach the conclusion that the accident was a contributing cause of the head injury which was more than negligible.The plaintiff has not established ground 3.Ground 4: the failure to respond to a substantial and clearly articulatedargumentThe plaintiff submitted that it had clearly put causation of the head/brain injury in issue in its submissions. More specifically, the plaintiff pointed out that it had raised three possibilities as to how any head/brain injury had been caused and contended that it was necessary for the review panel to undertake the task of determining which was the cause.It was the plaintiff’s contention that by failing to respond to the argument, the review panel denied procedural fairness and constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction.The plaintiff citedRodger v De Gelder and Others[2015] NSWCA 211(“De Gelder”)at [95] and [108]-[109] in which the review panel had failed to respond to a substantial argument and the Court of Appeal held that amounted to jurisdictional error.Mr Romaniuk referred to clauses 6.5 to 6.7 of the Guidelinesand argued that none of the three questions posed by the plaintiff in its submissions was the legal test to be applied. Senior Counsel contended that a demand to answer causal questions that are not correctly stated, does not lay the foundation for a complaint because the review panel would have misdirected itself in answering those questions.ConsiderationThe plaintiff’s contention relies upon the review panel’s failure to determine threepossibilitiesraised in its written submissions. Thosepossibilitieswere“whether the claimant solely suffered a brain injury in the accident, whether he solely suffered a brain injury due to the self-inflicted head strikes or whether there was a brain injury in the crash as well as self-inflicted head strikes”: review panel’s reasons at [91].InDe Gelder, Gleeson JA (with whomMacfarlanand Leeming JJA agreed) said at [93]:Where a decision-maker has failed to respond to a substantial argument it has been said that there has been a failure to accord natural justice, that is, procedural fairness:Dranichnikovv Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs[2003] HCA 26; 77 ALJR 1088. In such a case the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice:Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ExparteLam[2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at [37] (Gleeson CJ). It is well accepted that with respect to the MAC Act, procedural fairness applies to a review panel exercising powers under s 63:McKee v Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd[2008] NSWCA 163; 71 NSWLR 609 at [8] (AllsopP). Theparticular contentof this requirement will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case:Trazivukv Motor Accidents Authority (NSW)at [28];Frost vKouroucheat [2] and [41].InInsurance Australia Group Ltd t/as NRMA Insurance v Keen[2021] NSWCA 287 (“Keen”), Leeming JA (with whomBastenJA and Simpson AJA agreed) drew a distinction between a court’s task and that of an assessor. Leeming JA said at [39]-[40]:A court’s task is to resolve justiciable controversies, constituted by the parties’ competing claims. A court should address substantial and clearly articulated submissions, not least because there is a danger that the entirety of the dispute will not be resolved if some substantial submission is not addressed. A court may not need to resolve every issue, but it should make it clear why the submissions it has resolved are dispositive of the case and ideally why it is unnecessary to determine other submissions which have been advanced by the parties unless they are patently insubstantial.The function of the assessor is quite different. The assessor was obliged following the referral by SIRA to determine a quintessentially factual issue: the degree of permanent impairment suffered by Mr Keen caused by the motor accident, reduced to a percentage calculated in accordance with the Guidelines. As the High Court emphasised, speaking of the decisions of medical panels under theAccident Compensation Act 1985(Vic) inWingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd vKocak(2013) 252 CLR 480; [2013] HCA 43 at [47], the Medical Panel was not required to decide a dispute or make up its mind by reference to competing contentions or competing medical opinions:“The function of a Medical Panel is neither arbitral nor adjudicative: it is neither to choose between competing arguments, nor to opine on the correctness of other opinions on that medical question. The function is in every case to form and to give its own opinion on the medical question referred to it by applying its own medical experience and its own medical expertise.”.In that case, the Court rejected the insurer’s argument that the medical assessor’s failure to respond to what was said to be a substantial argument thatwent to causation amounted to a denial of procedural fairnessoralternatively, a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. Leeming JA said at [45]:… His Honour was correct at [119] to place emphasis on the passage atWingfootat [47] that it was not the function of a medical assessor to adjudicate or arbitrate between competing opinions.Whilst itmaybe doubted that in accordance with the Court of Appeal’s reasons inKeenthe review panel wasobliged to answer the plaintiff’spossibilities, the plaintiff’s contention may be rejected on another basis.I am not persuaded that the threepossibilitiesraise a“substantial argument”. AsBastenJAexplained inInsurance Australia Ltd t/as NRMA Insurance v Milton[2016] NSWCA 156 (“Milton”) at [9],“a substantial argument means one which is clearly material or undoubted relevance”.The determination of what is a material or relevant consideration is to be identified by reference to the“constituting statute (or any other source of jurisdiction) and not primarily, by reference to the submissions of a party”:Miltonat [10]-[11].The scope of the statutory functions of a review of medical assessments by the review panel are found in s 7.26 of the Act(reproduced at[38] above) for which guidance is provided in the Guidelines.The review panel’s task was to determine whether the head injury was caused or materially contributed to by the accident. The guidance provided bycl6.7of the Guidelinesprovided that the accident did not have to be the sole cause“as long as it is a contributing cause, which was more than negligible”. The review panel undertook its task in accordance with theGuidelinesand s 5D of theCivil Liability Act 2002(NSW).The plaintiff’s threepossibilitiesraisedmattersof fact which the review panel was under no legal obligation to answer.Thesepossibilitieswere part of the plaintiff’s submission to the review panel that the head injury and related symptoms were not causally related to the accident but were self-inflicted. This was the plaintiff’s substantial argument which the review panel responded to in its statement of reasons.The review panel’s failure to specifically answer the threepossibilitiesin its statement of reasons does not amount to a failure to accord natural justice and jurisdictional error.The plaintiff has not established ground 4.ConclusionGiven that none of the grounds raised by the plaintiff have been made good, thesummons seeking judicial review must be dismissed.I makethe following orders:Orderthatthe summons filed 24 November 2023 be dismissed.Orderthatthe plaintiff pay the first defendant’s costs in this Court.**********Endnotes1.Tcpt, 2 August 2024, p 2(19-20).2.Tcpt, 2 August 2024, p 3(6-8).3.Tcpt, 2 August 2024, p 14(35-36).4.Defendant’s Written Submissions, Dated 16 July 2024, at [29].5.Tcpt, 2 August 2024, p 15(30-31).DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Section 164 imposes an obligation on a witness served with an Australian subpoena to comply with that subpoena, and there could not be a plainer indication that theNew Zealand legislature does not object to the service of such a subpoena on a witness in New Zealand.

That provision also recognises the legislature's consent to the service of such a subpoena and also addresses another relevant issue for the exercise of the Court's discretion. There is here no lack of utility in the issue of a subpoena, and no risk that it could be disregarded with immunity, because the New Zealand Courts have the authority, under theEvidence Act(NZ), to impose a significant penalty upon a person who disregards a subpoena issued by this Court, where that person is resident in New Zealand."}, {"p_num": 13, "text": "Section 166 in turn provides a process by which documents in response to a subpoena issued by this Court, and served in New Zealand, may be produced to a Registry of the High Court in New Zealand, and then transmitted by that Court to Australia, and that process will be drawn by the Plaintiffs to Mega Aqua’s attention.."}, {"p_num": 14, "text": "I have in turn been taken to the subpoena to produce, in its revised form in MFI 1, and Mr Condon, in submissions, identifies the matters in issue in the contempt application to which the subpoena is directed, with a view to assisting the Plaintiffs in the proper forensic process of proof of the elements of the contempt which they seek to establish.

Accordingly, I make the following orders:"}], "full_text": "Judgment– ex tempore (Revised22 August 2024)Nature of the application and applicable rulesBy Notice of Motion filed 1 March 2024, the Plaintiffs,SunnyaPty Ltd andJatcorpLtd seek, relevantly, an order under r 11.8AB of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) or in the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, granting them leave to serve a subpoena (in the form marked MFI 1, as revised from that annexed to the Motion) on Mega Aqua Ltd (\"Mega Aqua\") in New Zealand.Rule 11.8AB of the UCPR, relevantly provides that:“Any document other than an originating process may be served outside of Australia with the leave of the court, which may be given within the directions that the court thinks fit.\"The form of Notice of Motion recognises that, as a matter of New Zealand law, it would be appropriate that the subpoena be accompanied by a copy of the order of this Court granting leave to serve the subpoena and a notice in a form which the Plaintiffs have brought to my attention. Mr Condon, who appears for the Plaintiffs, rightly recognises that no order of this Court is required in that respect.The application is brought in the context of an ongoing application by the Plaintiffs for an order that Mr Wu be found guilty of contempt as charged in a statement of charge, and that he be punished with contempt as charged in that statement of charge. There is evidence, in previous applications before the Court, that Mr Wu has been served with documents relating to the contempt application and, by orders made on 31 July 2024, I granted leave for the Plaintiffs to proceed against Mr Wu in relation to the proceedings for contempt, Notwithstanding that he had not filed a notice of appearance.The Plaintiffs rely on the affidavit dated 19 February 2024 of their solicitor, Mr Zhu, which refers to previous attempts to serve documents upon about Mr Wu and the Plaintiffs’wish to have Mega Aqua, a New Zealand limited company which is associated with Mr Wu, produce documents in respect of matters that were in issue in proceedings in this Court, and are plainly in issue in respect of the contempt application. Mr Zhu refers to advice provided by a New Zealand practitioner that, under s 163 of theEvidence Act2006 (NZ), an Australian subpoena may be served on a witness in New Zealand provided that it is accompanied by a copy of an order granting leave by an Australian Court and a statement of the rights of the recipient of the subpoena. The relevant provisions, to which I have been taken, extend to a subpoena to produce documents. Mr Zhu also refers to the advice that he was provided, again consistent with theEvidence Act(NZ), that a witness served in New Zealand with an Australian subpoena must comply with the subpoena, and that relevant New Zealand laws do not restrict these provisions to subpoenas issued in Australian pursuant to theTrans-Tasman Proceedings Act2010 (Cth). I will note further relevant provisions of theEvidence Act(NZ) below.Submissions and applicable legal principlesMr Condon, who appears for the Plaintiffs, refers to UCPR r 11.8AB to which I have referred above. He notes that the contempt application is not brought under theTrans-Tasman Proceedings Act2010 (Cth), which does not deal with proceedings for contempt, and the Court has already dealt with the basis on which the application may properly be served in New Zealand in previousjudgments. Mr Condon also refers to the case law in respect of r 11.8AB and has drawn attention to two further cases in the course of oral submissions. He recognises that there are concerns, at least in some circumstances, as to international comity in the context of a subpoena served overseas, where such a subpoena is intrusive into another State's territorial sovereignty. The are also particular concerns as to utility, if the Court could ultimately not impose a sanction for non-compliance with the subpoena, with the result that a party could practically refuse compliance with the subpoena at will. As I will note below, neither of those issues arises in respect of a subpoena issued to a New Zealand resident.It is convenient here to address the additional case law to which Mr Condor refers, before turning to the scope of the New Zealand legislation. He draws attention to the observations of White J inGloucester (Sub-Holdings 1) Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue[2013] NSWSC 1419, particularly at [28]ff, where his Honour adopted a somewhat narrower approach than had previously been taken byHallenAsJinCaswell v Sony/ATV Music Publishing (Australia) Pty Ltd[2012] NSWSC 986. InGloucesterWhite J observed (at [29]) that the authorities:“...establish that the court's power to grant leave to issue a subpoena to a person outside Australia is to be exercised in accordance with the principle of comity that respects the sovereignty of a foreign a country, unless it is shown that the foreign country does not object to the purported exercise of judicial power by this State against persons in the foreign State.”Mr Condon also draws attention to the decision ofWigneyJ in the Federal Court of Australia inCeramic Fuel Ltd (inliq) v McGraw Hill Financial Inc(2016) 245 FCR 340; [2016] FCA 401, where his Honour noted (at [11]) that the question whether the Court has power to grant leave to issue a subpoena to a person outside Australia is controversial and, to an extent, remains unsettled. It may be that, strictly, there is no question as to the Court's power to issue such a subpoena, where that is derived from the relevant rule, but the controversy exists as to the question whether the discretion to exercise a subpoena should be issued, generally and in particular cases. His Honour noted that the authorities were difficult to reconcile and do not provide a definitive or consistentanswer to the relevant questions, and to that extent does not appear to have adopted either the wider view taken byHallenAsJin Caswell or the narrower and more exacting view taken by White J inGloucester.His Honour recognised (at [48]) that the corresponding rules of the Federal Court of Australia would, read literally, appear to empower the Court to issue and serve a subpoena on a foreign addressee, but also acknowledged that those rules should be read so as not to be inconsistent with international comity, and his Honour observed (at [50]) that:“The requirement to construe general rules in a way which is consistent with international law and the comity of nations is best accommodated by requiring the Court to have regard to those matters, and to exercise care and restraint, when being asked to issue and grant leave to serve a subpoena overseas. Whilst the Court is bound to have regard to international law and comity and exercise care and restraint, it nonetheless retains the power to issue and grant leave to serve a subpoena overseas in an appropriate case.”Here, having regard to the provisions of theEvidence Act(NZ), it seems to me it is not necessary to decide whether a wider, narrower or intermediate view should be adopted. It is plain that, even adopting the narrowest test articulated by White J inGloucester, New Zealand does not object to the purported exercise of judicial power by this State against persons in New Zealand. That is plain because Pt 4 of theEvidence Act(NZ) dealing with proceedings in Australia and New Zealand, has specific provisions which deal with the service of Australian subpoenas in New Zealand. Section 163(1), to which Mr Condon referred in submissions, permits an Australian subpoena to be served on a witness in New Zealand, although s 163(2) requires it be accompanied by documents of the kind that the Plaintiff proposes to serve in this case.The term \"subpoena\" is defined, in s 150, as including a process that requires a person to produce a document or thing, and the subpoena the Plaintiffs propose to issue here is of that character. It excludes a process that requires a person to produce a document in connection with discovery and inspection of documents, but the subpoena in issue here is not of that character. Section 164 imposes an obligation on a witness served with an Australian subpoena to comply with that subpoena, and there could not be a plainer indication that theNew Zealand legislature does not object to the service of such a subpoena on a witness in New Zealand. There are certain exceptions to that obligation in s 164(2), but they will operate in accordance with their terms, and it is not apparent they would have any application here.Section 165 in turn provides that the High Court of New Zealand may, on receiving from the Australian Court which issued the Australian subpoena a certificate stating that the witness has failed to comply with the subpoena, issue a warrant requiring a member of the police in New Zealand to arrest the witness and to bring him or her before the High Court and, on the appearance of that witness before the Court, to impose a fine not exceeding a substantial amount unless the Court is satisfied the failure to comply with the subpoena should be excused. That provision also recognises the legislature's consent to the service of such a subpoena and also addresses another relevant issue for the exercise of the Court's discretion. There is here no lack of utility in the issue of a subpoena, and no risk that it could be disregarded with immunity, because the New Zealand Courts have the authority, under theEvidence Act(NZ), to impose a significant penalty upon a person who disregards a subpoena issued by this Court, where that person is resident in New Zealand.Section 166 in turn provides a process by which documents in response to a subpoena issued by this Court, and served in New Zealand, may be produced to a Registry of the High Court in New Zealand, and then transmitted by that Court to Australia, and that process will be drawn by the Plaintiffs to Mega Aqua’s attention..The scope of the subpoenaI have in turn been taken to the subpoena to produce, in its revised form in MFI 1, and Mr Condon, in submissions, identifies the matters in issue in the contempt application to which the subpoena is directed, with a view to assisting the Plaintiffs in the proper forensic process of proof of the elements of the contempt which they seek to establish. I am satisfied the subpoena is directed to matters that are relevant, and has a proper forensic purpose, in respect ofthe contempt application, and that it is not oppressive. In these circumstances, there is nothing in the terms of the subpoena itself which means that the Court should not grant the leave which is sought.Determination and ordersFor these reasons, and bearing in mind the approach which is taken in New Zealand law to a subpoena issued by an Australian Court, I am comfortably satisfied that the Court should make an order in the form sought by the Plaintiff'sNotice ofMotion. Accordingly, I make the following orders:1.Order that the Plaintiffs have leave to serve on Mega Aqua Ltd in New Zealand a subpoena in the form of the draft subpoena marked \"MFI 1\" together with the annexures identified therein.2.Costs reserved.3.The matter be listed in the Corporations Motions List at 9.15am on 30 September 2024 for further directions.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

I am satisfied that that view is well founded and, on that basis, the Court should also grant the relief which is sought in that respect.Ms Scott also points to a further order that is sought, confirming that the indemnity for the voluntary administrators is available from the property of the Aeon Group, in respect of all of the debts and liabilities incurred by the voluntary administrators under the funding agreement. I am satisfied that that order is properly made, where the sale process and borrowing will take place for thebenefit of the Aeon Group as a whole, as would the sale process, and the indemnity should properly be available from group assets in that situation.OrdersFor these reasons, I made the orders sought in the application.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Completion took place on 1 August 2022.Skybridge commenced these proceedings on 11 August 2023. In itsListStatement filed on 5 September 2023, it alleged breaches of provisions in the contract that allowed Mr Buckpitt to recover from his former clients work in progress that was invoiced at the date of completion. The other allegation Skybridge makes is that Mr Buckpitt has sought to recover un-invoiced work in progress from identified clients.The contract also contained a restraint clause. In Skybridge’s currentListStatement, only one breach of that clause is alleged, namely, that in relation to an identified client:“On 15 June 2023,Mr Buckpitt entered the premises of [that client].MrBuckpitttold...the office manager of [that client] that he had sold his business to Skybridge.MrBuckpitttold [that office manager] that Skybridge had sacked him.[However,]MrBuckpitthanded [that office manager] a cheque for $4,400 by way of part repayment for [certain payments].”That is the only allegation the company made in Skybridge’sListStatement concerning the restraint clause.Skybridge served its evidence late on 30 April 2024. That evidence included an affidavit from one of its directors, Mr Jason Birch, to which I will return. However, also included in that evidence was an affidavit from Skybridge’s solicitor suggesting that Skybridge’s damages would be modest indeed. Mr Buckpitt served his corroborating affidavit on or about 25 July 2024.At adirectionshearing on 26 July 2024,the Court extended the time for Skybridge to serve its evidence in reply and ordered that any application for leave to serve expert evidence orobtaindiscovery be made returnable today. It was in thatcontext that Skybridge then was seeking a date for hearing and that, in effect, informed the Court that the matter was otherwise ready for a hearing.Now, by notice of motion filed on 2 August 2024, Skybridge seeks leave to amend itsSummons andListStatement to make allegations of breach by Mr Buckpitt of the restraint clauses,and also seeks discovery. However, the proposed amendment by Skybridge of its claim was not foreshadowed prior to the filing of the notice of motion. The amendments propose to add a number of incidences where Mr Buckpitt is seeking to recoverun-invoiced work in progress, but it also adds nine claims of alleged solicitation of clients in breach of the restraint clause. In each case,the form of the allegation is:on a date between about November 2023 and 15 April 2024,Mr Buckpitt agreed or offered to give accountingandtaxation advice to [the client];on a date between 13 November 2023 and 15 April 2024,Mr Buckpitt caused himself to be registered as the tax agent for [theclient] with the Australian TaxationOffice;on dates between 13 November 2023 and 15 April 2024 and after, Mr Buckpitt acted for [the client] by providing accounting and taxation services.The basis for these allegations against those nine clients appears to be no more than that:on13 November 2023,Mr Buckpitt wrote to the Tax Practitioner’s Board saying that he had sold his tax and accounting business butsaying:“I now wish to attend tax return preparations for clients again in a much smaller way”; andasearch made on 15 April 2024on the Australian Taxation Office’s tax agent portal,which lists those nine clients against Mr Buckpitt’s name.In that regard,part of the evidence served for Skybridge on 30 April 2024 was the affidavit of Mr Birch,to which I have referred, in which he deposed:“On 15 April 2024, I received an email from Ms Lyon in which she attached an extract of the ATO tax agent portal for Buckpitt Accounting & Tax which showed additional Accounting Clients had Buckpitt Accounting & Tax registered as their tax agents. … This extract may be accessed via the ATO tax portal. In that extract, the names appearing below the column entitled “Name” are the names of some of the Accounting Clients who are now clients of Mr Buckpitt as at 15 April 2024. In my experience with engaging clients and registering them as my clients on the ATO portal, the tax agent must take active steps to log into the ATO Portal and add the client on their ATO portal as their client. An accountant needs to be registered as a client’s tax agent in order to be able to lodge their tax returns.”Skybridge has knownofthe matters in[8(a)]above,I take it,since at least30November 2023, on which date Mr Buckpitt’s email was annexed to an affidavit by an officer of Skybridge made in support of an earlierapplication,andhas known of the matterin[8(b)]abovesince 15 April 2023.However, it has also been open to Skybridge to seek to propound the amendments the subject of its applicationsincethen. There is no evidence before me to explain why it is only now that Skybridge seeks to amend, savingthat Mr Lees has informed me, and I accept, that it has only occurred to those advising Skybridge since the matter was last before the Court that these amendments oughtto besought.It is obviously unsatisfactory that the matter has developed this way. It may well be that,faced with the apparently immodest monetary value of the claim as currently pleaded,the thoughts of those advising Skybridge turned to other possible claims. However that may be, I cannot see how it would be just to shut out Skybridge from seeking to pursue these matters. Therefore, I propose to permit the proposed amendments. There will,however,be conditions.Mr Lees informed me that,were leave granted to make the proposed amendments, Skybridge would not seek to adduce further evidence.

I was inclined to direct that those costs include the further costs that Mr Buckpitt will incur in adducing that further evidence and to grant Mr Buckpitt leave to apply for a gross sum costs order in relation to those costs, however, on reflection, my conclusion is that those costs, or at least the bulk of them, would likely have been incurred in any event had this amendment been made in a more timely manner and that this question is best left to the trial judge.However, Skybridge must pay thedefendants’costsof its notice of motion seeking leave. I propose to make a gross sum costs order in relation to those costspayableforthwithandorder that leave to amend be conditional upon those costs being paid within seven days of entry of orders giving effect to these reasons.If the parties cannot confer and agree on a figure for Mr Buckpitt’s costs of Skybridge’s motion, the parties should confer and agree on a timetable for short written submissions and any evidence on that question I will decide on the papers.As to the question of discovery, Skybridge has proposed categories of discovery. I propose to direct the parties to prepare a RedfernSchedule in which Skybridge sets out in one column the categories of discovery it seeks and in a second column its argument in favour of disclosure of those categories. Mr Buckpitt should then populate a third column with his contention as to why the disclosure should not be given. TheSchedule should provide a fourth column for me to populate it with my rulingsI will decide then.The parties should now agree on the orders necessary to give effect to these reasons and also for the directions for the future conduct of the matter, including, no doubt, an amended list response by Mr Buckpitt.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

LZI is a company controlled by Mr Tinkler’s father, a number of the group members in the proceedings are related or associated with Mr Tinkler and the funder of the proceedings is a company associated with Mr Tinkler. Mr Tinkler will be one of the principal lay witnesses for LZI at the trial in support of its case.On 7 May 2019, these proceedings were transferred to this court.On 12 July 2019, LZI was substituted as plaintiff in the proceedings in place of Mr Tinkler.Legal representationIn the proceedings, SMB Law act as solicitors for LZI and Allens act as solicitors for Whitehaven.Evidence timetabling orders,service of evidenceand inquiries of potential expertsOn 2 September 2021,Registrar Waltonmade timetabling orders requiringLZIto serve any lay evidenceupon which it intended to rely in the proceedingsby 2 December 2021, noting that those timetabling orders would be suspended or revised if an amended claim was filed or an application to amend made by LZI.On 7 December 2021, Ward CJ in Eq (asthe Presidentthen was)directed LZI to serve any amended statement of claim by 21 January 2022, andorderedthat ifLZIfailed to serve any amended statement of claim by that date, it wasto servealllayand expertevidenceon which it intended to rely in the proceedingsby 31 January 2022.On 13 April 2022, Ball Jgranted LZI leave to amend its statement of claim andordered LZIto serve anylay andexpert evidencein chiefby 23 September 2022.On 20 May 2022, Ball Jvacated theorderof 13 April 2022 requiringLZIto serveits lay and expert evidence in chief by 23 September 2022 and ordered that LZI serve itslay andexpert evidencein chiefby 7 October 2022.On 14 June 2022, Ball Jvacated the order of 20 May 2022 requiring LZI to serve its lay and expert evidence in chief by 7 October 2022 andorderedthatLZIserveitslay andexpert evidencein chiefby 21 October 2022.On 24 February 2023, Ball J made ordersby consentextending the time forLZIto serve anylayevidence (order 1)andexpert evidence(order 2) on which it intended to relyto6 April 2023, subject to a guillotine order as follows:4.The Plaintiff not be permitted to rely on any lay affidavit evidence or expert evidence not served in accordance with orders 1 and 2 without leave of the Court.During March 2023, SMB Law made enquiries of 13 people in an effort to identify a suitable expert to provide evidence on the process for obtaining mining leases and any relevant environmental and planning approvals for a coal mining development in New South Wales. None of those enquiries were successful for a variety of reasons, including the previous links that potential experts had with Whitehaven and their unavailability to complete the work within time, which at that stage was an evidence deadline of 6 April 2023.On 21 March 2023, SMB Law sent a letter by email to Allens seeking their consent for an extension of time to serve expert evidence, citing the difficultiesthey had experienced in identifying an expert who was not conflicted, who was proposed to answer issues which LZI’s primary mining expert did not have the expertise to address.On 21 March 2023, Allens sent an email to SMB Law stating that Whitehaven did not consent to the proposed extension of the expert evidence deadline.It appears that LZI then ceased all efforts to serve expert evidence in chief in relation to the coal mineplanning and approval issues.On 14 April 2023, Ball J made ordersby consentextending the time forLZIto serve any expertevidenceto 14 April 2023(order 1), subject to a guillotine orderas follows:2The Plaintiff not be permitted to rely on any expert evidence not served in accordance with order 1 without leave of the Court.On 6 and14 April 2023,LZIservedits lay evidence andalso itsexpert evidencein the formof ageologyexpertreport of Barry Saundersdated14 April 2023 and an accountingexpertreport of Dawna Kathleen Wrightdated6 April 2023.No other expert evidence was served by LZI.On 30 November 2023, Whitehaven served its lay and expert evidence in the form ofaffidavits from four lay witnesses and three experts’reports and indicated that a further expert report would be served the following day.On 1 December 2023, Whitehaven served the initial form of the O’Connor report.The O’Connor report addresses coal mine planning and approval issues in the proceedings.On 6 December 2023, Whitehaven served the amended form of the O’Connor report, correcting a minor numbering error.On 8 December 2023,StevensonJ made ordersrequiringLZIto serve anyevidence in reply by 8 March 2024and to serve a list of those documentson which it intended to rely at the hearing by 8 April 2024.InlateFebruary 2024, SMB Law made enquiries of two further people in an effort to identify an appropriate expert to provide evidenceon the coal mineplanning and approval issues.On15 March 2024, Ball J made orders extending the time forLZIto serveits lay and expert evidence in replyas well as a guillotine order. Those orders were in the following terms:1The time for [LZI] to serve any expert forensic accounting report in reply be extended to 22 March 2024.2The time for [LZI] to serve any lay evidence in reply be extended to 5 April 2024.…4The time for[LZI]to serve any expert geology report in reply be extended to 19 April 2024.4A[LZI]not be entitled to serve evidence after those dates without leave of the Court.5The time for the Plaintiff to serve a list of those documents upon which it intends to rely at the hearing of this matter be extended to 19 April 2024.On22 March 2024, LZI served theforensicaccounting expert report of Dawna Wright.On 19 April 2024, LZI served the geology expert report of Barry Saunders.On 22 April 2024, Allens sent an email to SMB Law which stated, amongst other things, that they assumed that LZI’s lay and expert evidence was now complete and asked for urgent confirmation if that was not the case.On 22 April 2024, SMB Law sent a letter by email to Allensconfirming, amongst other things, that LZI’s lay and expert evidence was now complete.On 26 April 2024, Ball Jfixedthe matter for hearing commencing 2 September 2024 with an estimate of 15 daysandmade the usual order for hearing.The identification of Mr Mullard as anexpertand service of the Mullard reportOn 25 June 2024, a conference took place betweenMrTinkler,counsel for LZI (David Pritchard SCandAngus Macauley), Matthew DavisandArmany Chaouk at whichMrMullard was identifiedby Mr Tinkleras being a possible expert to provide evidenceon the coal mine planning and approval issues.Mr Mullard had not been previously identified or approached when SMB Law had been making enquiries in March 2023 and February 2024.On 26 June 2024,SMB Lawobtained contact details for Mr Mullard.On 27 June 2024,Mr Briggsof SMB Lawspoke to Mr Mullard for the first time about his expertise and availability to provide an expert report.On 28 June 2024,SMB Lawsent an email to Mr Mullard with an outline of the scope of the expert report and a copy of the O’Connor report.On 11 July 2024,SMB Lawsent a letter of instruction to Mr Mullard.On 18 July 2024,SMB Lawsent a letterby emailto Allens providing them with a copy of the letter of instruction to Mr Mullard.On 25 July 2024, Allens sent a letterby emailto SMB Law stating thatWhitehavendid not consent to the report of Mr Mullard being relied upon.On30July 2024,SMB Lawsentaletter by email to Allens attaching acopy oftheMullard report.On 30 July 2024, Allens sent an email to SMB Law stating thatWhitehavendid not consent toLZIbeing granted leave to rely upon the Mullard report.On 6 August 2024, LZI filed the notice of motion making this application.LEGAL PRINCIPLESRule 31.28 of the UCPR is in the following form:31.28Disclosure of experts’ reports and hospital reports(1)Each party must serve experts’ reports and hospital reports on each other active party—(a)in accordance with any order of the court, or(b)if no such order is in force, in accordance with any relevant practice note, or(c)if no such order or practice note is in force, not later than 28 days before the date of the hearing at which the report is to be used.(2)An application to the court for an order under subrule (1) (other than an order solely for abridgment or extension of time) may be made without serving notice of motion.(3)Except by leave of the court, or by consent of the parties—(a)an expert’s report or hospital report is not admissible unless it has been served in accordance with this rule, and(b)without limiting paragraph (a), an expert’s report or hospital report, when tendered under section 63, 64 or 69 of theEvidence Act 1995, is not admissible unless it has been served in accordance with this rule, and(c)the oral expert evidence in chief of any expert is not admissible unless an expert’s report or hospital report served in accordance with this rule contains the substance of the matters sought to be adduced in evidence.(4)Leave is not to be given as referred to in subrule (3) unless the court is satisfied—(a)that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant the granting of leave, or(b)that the report concerned merely updates an earlier version of a report that has been served in accordance with subrule (1).Practice NoteSC Eq 3 Commercial List and Construction and Technology Listis relevant for me to consider, as the usual order for hearing referred to in [49]of the Practice Noteand contained in Annexure 3provides,relevantly,as follows:USUAL ORDER FOR HEARINGExperts’ Reports1.In any case in which there is expert evidence to be relied upon by the parties, the experts are to meet no later than three weeks before trialfor the purpose of reaching agreement on as many issues as possible and producing:1.1a joint report; and1.2any separate report(s) dealing with those matters that are unable to be agreed.2.The joint report and any separate report(s) are to be filed and served no later than five working days before trial.3.In cases in which expert evidence is to be given concurrently, the experts are to meet no later than three weeks prior to trial for the purpose of producing:3.1a joint report;3.2any separate report(s) dealing with those matters that are unable to be agreed; and3.3a draft agenda for discussion of the contested issues in the concurrent evidence session at trial.4.The joint report and any separate report(s) and the draft agenda are to be filed and served no later than 5 working days before trial.…In exercising my discretion I must also have regard to the requirements of ss 56, 57 and 58 of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW) (CPA).The overriding purpose of the CPA and the UCPR in their application to civil proceedings in this court is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings: s 56(1) of the CPA. I must seek to give effect to that overriding purpose when I exercise any power in the CPA or the UCPR: s 56(2) of the CPA.In seeking to give effect to the overriding purpose, I must have regard to the objects of the just determination of the proceedings, the efficient disposal of the business of the court, the efficient use of available judicial and administrative resources, and the timely disposal of the proceedings at a cost affordable by the respective parties: s 57(1) of the CPA.The principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion in r 31.28 of the UCPR are conveniently summarised inDoloresCorreaand The Spanish Club Limited(subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) v Kenneth Michael Whittingham[2012] NSWSC 266, Black J at [10]–[13] saying as follows:[10]I turn now to r 31.28(3) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules which provides that, except by leave of the Court or by the parties' consent, an expert's report is not admissible unless it has been served in accordance with the rule. Rule 31.28(4) in turn provides that leave is not to be given unless the Court is satisfied that:(a)there are exceptional circumstances that warrant the grant of leave; or(b)the report merely updates an earlier version of a report that has been served in accordance with sub-rule (1).[11]It is not suggested that Mr Lloyd's report is an updating of any earlier expert evidence report. The plaintiffs therefore seek to establish \"exceptional circumstances\" within the scope of r 31.28(4). That concept was considered inYacoub v Pilkington (Australia) Ltd[2007] NSWCA 290 at [66]-[67] where Campbell JA referred to his judgment inSan v Rumble (No 2)[2007] NSWCA 259 at [59]-[69] and observed that, inter alia, exceptional circumstances are out of the ordinary course or unusual, special or uncommon and cannot be circumstances that are regularly, routinely or normally encountered, and can exist by reference to quantitative or qualitative factors. His Honour noted that whether circumstances are exceptional for the purposes of a particular provision depended on the rationale of that provision and required consideration of the particular facts. His Honour also observed that:\"In the context of r 31.18(4) [the predecessor of UCPR r 31.28(4)], any decision about whether there are exceptional circumstances would need to bear in mind the explicit statement of objectives of a Court in the management of litigation contained in ss 56-59 Civil Procedure Act 2005.\"[12]InState of New South Wales v Tyszyk[2008] NSWCA 107, to which Mr Gray referred in submissions, Campbell JA quoted that passage and held that exceptional circumstances were in that case established where the reports had already been cross-examined on, had been in the plaintiff's possession for over a year, a reasonable time for the plaintiff to deal with the tender of the reports had elapsed and there was a lack of any identifiable prejudice to the plaintiff. It does not seem to me that the present case is comparable toState of New South Wales v Tyszyk. Mr Lloyd's expert report has not been cross-examined on and had been in the defendant's possession for a week, not a year, prior to the commencement of the hearing, and there seems to me to be a real prejudice in placing the defendant in a position where it has no practical alternative to leading expert evidence in response with insufficient time to prepare it, or seeking to vacate the hearing date.[13]There also seems to me to be a lack of exceptionality in the present circumstances which are, in substance, a case of late retainer of an expert and late service of his report. That is, regrettably, not out of theordinary course or special, although it is perhaps less common in recent years than in earlier years where the Courts and the parties were less conscious of the need of the parties and the community for the just, quick and cheap resolution of matters in dispute.Correawas cited with approval inCommonwealth Bank v Iinvest (No 7)[2017] NSWSC 440 by Campbell J at [10].InKelly v Thorn[2020] NSWSC 1933, Cavanagh J at [27] considered the notion of exceptional circumstances, stating:In my view, exceptional circumstances may be grounded by one powerful factor or a combination of factors. A combination of factors will include in a particular case the explanation afforded by the party for the failure to comply with the rules and whether there are available ameliorating conditions. By that, I mean that if the prejudice to the other party can be cured, that is a factor that can be taken into account in making a finding of exceptional circumstances.Recently, inOwners Strata Plan 9784 v Mirvac Projects Pty Ltd[2024] NSWSC 741, Stevenson Jrefused to grant leave to rely upon an expert report served after a guillotine order, stating at [14] and [21]:[14]In order to obtain leave to rely on evidence served in the face of a guillotine order, especially one that was consented to, what is required is an adequate, comprehensive, and candid explanation for the failure to comply with the order.…[21]But there is a wider question at play here. Parties in this List should not expect to be granted leave to rely on evidence served late and in the face of a guillotine order, especially one to which they had consented, without an explanation having the characteristics that I have described, namely one that is adequate, comprehensive and, most importantly, candid.In relation to granting leave to extend a deadline for the service of evidence,the principle ofexceptional circumstanceshas alsobeen applied,even where a hearing is not imminent:Pesecv Zivko (No 2)[2022] ACTSC 270.InPesec, Elkaim J at [15] declined to extend a deadline to serve expert evidence to 7 October 2022, one week after thedate of the hearing of the application,for a trial due to commence on 6 March 2023stating:This is not only an oppression suit, but also a commercial matter, which is supposed to proceed with efficiency and expedition. The limit to the extension of orders was reached before McCallum CJ. I am not prepared to yet again allow an extension. It will be unfortunate if the plaintiff is prejudiced by the lack of the expert reports. However this result will be a product arising from the plaintiff’s own camp, in particular the plaintiff’s failure to provide instructions to his solicitor to engage experts until 6 June 2022, some three days before the then existing deadline.The parties before me agreed that I must find exceptional circumstances to grant leave to LZI to rely on the Mullard report.CONSIDERATIONWhile having to find exceptional circumstances in the exercise of the discretion under r31.28 of the UCPR, I also need to weigh up a number of different factors, conscious that I shouldtogive effect tofacilitatingthe just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings,while havingregard to the objects of the just determination of the proceedings, the efficient disposal of the business of the court, the efficient use of available judicial and administrative resources, and the timely disposal of the proceedings at a cost affordable by the respective parties.Nature of the evidenceThe Mullard report and the O’Connor report address questionsthatare relevant to an important issue in the proceedings, which is the process for achieving“triggers”in relation to Ferndale and Oaklands North.The Mullard report responds to the O’Connor report. Much of the Mullard report agrees with the contents of the O’Connor report. The Mullard report also identifies the issues in the O’Connor report with which Mr Mullard does not agree.Whitehaven has, however, identified particular parts of the Mullard reportinvolving disagreement between the respective expertsto which it cannotadequately respond withintheshort space of timebefore the trial is due to commence.These parts relate to the reasons which are identified by Mr Mullardin[3.5.3.10]of the Mullard reportfor his conclusionthat he does not agree with Mr O’Connor“that it is very unlikely that a development consent could not have been granted under the NSWMining Act1992over the Ferndale Site”, which refer back to the detail provided in section 3.3.3 of the Mullard report.Injustice to LZIIf I do not give leave to LZI to rely on the Mullard report, LZI will be without any expert evidence in opposition to the O’Connor reportfrom a person (Mr Mullard) who would appear to be qualified to give that evidence.I am conscious that this wouldcause injustice to LZI.DelaysThe proceedings have been punctuated by repeated delays by LZI in serving its evidence in proceedings which have already taken overfiveyears to come to trial in the Commercial List of this court. Such a delay is highly unusual in the Commercial List which operates to giveparties theefficient disposal of commercial causes.While I consider that LZI has given a comprehensive and candid explanation of its efforts to identify a potential expert witness in March 2023, February 2024 and June 2024,the explanation is not adequatebecausethose efforts have not been undertaken in a timely fashion.The delay has been very significant. Either the expert report should have been served in chief by14 April 2023(in which case the delay could be seen asbeing in excess of15 months) or in reply by8 March 2024(in which case the delay can be seen asbeing in excess of4 months).Thelatesearches which occurred in March 2023 took place under the spectre of a loomingdate of6 April 2023for the service of expert evidence in chief, combined with a guillotine order made by consent. No explanation was given as to why LZI was so dilatoryin undertaking its task.The searches which occurred at the end of February 2024 were also late, with theevidence in replyrequired to be servedby 8 March 2024.No attempt was made to explain why it took from the beginning of December 2023, when the O’Connor report was served, until late February 2024 to commence the search for an expert to provide expert evidence in reply.No evidence has been given about anyenquiries made of Mr Tinkler (the person who identified Mr Mullard) before 25 June 2024 in an effort to locate a potential expert.In my assessment, the delays by LZI are not adequately explained.Prejudice to WhitehavenI am conscious that Whitehaven has identified areas of the Mullard report to which it cannot adequately respond before the trial is due to commence. I have stated those matters above.Whitehaven submits that Mr O’Connor will not have sufficient time to properly considerthe issues raised by,and respond to,the Mullard report in the time available before the trial, meaning that Whitehaven will not have a fair opportunity to test the Mullard report with Mr O’Connor prior to the hearing.LZI only informedWhitehavenofitsproposal to obtain an expert report from Mr Mullard on 18 July 2024. Prior to this time,Whitehavenhad been proceeding on the assumptionunequivocallyconfirmed by SMB Law’s letter of 22 April 2024 that LZI’s lay and expert evidence was complete.On 31 July 2024, one day after the Mullard report was servedon Whitehaven, Mr O’Connor was on leave at a remote location and was not able to review the Mullard report until after his return on 8 August 2024. Whitehavenhadpreviously made LZI aware of Mr O’Connor’s absence.As at 13 August 2024, Mr O’Connor has confirmed that he has commenced reading the Mullard report but has not yet reviewed it in detail.Mr O’Connor has also advised that he is unable to participate in an expert conclave with Mr Mullard onmultiple days inAugust and early September 2024 due to prior commitments. Whitehaven says that another reason why an expert conclave between Mr O’Connor and Mr Mullard should not occur is thatit is likely to take some time given thatthe expert conclave between the geologists lastedfivedays.I consider thatWhitehaven would suffer significant prejudice as there is nopropertime available between now and the trial for Mr O’Connor to sufficiently familiarise himself with the Mullard report, prepare and participate in a conclave, for the conclave to occur and a joint report to be prepared.Such an outcome would be unjust to Whitehaven.Efficient disposal, efficient use of resources and timely disposal at cost affordableThe trial is fixed to occur between3and 20 September 2024. Thisisa long trial in the Commercial List. Those dates have been fixed since 26 April 2024. There are no other trial dates available for the proceedings to be heard until well into 2025. LZI submits that it wishes the trial to remain as fixed. As a result, any prejudice to Whitehaven cannot becuredby the vacation of the trial and an order for wasted costs.ConclusionI have not been able to identify any exceptional circumstances which could form the basis on which I would grant leave to LZI to rely on the Mullard report. This is a case in which LZI is seeking to visit the consequences of its own inadequately explained delay to the prejudice of Whitehaven. Parties bringing proceedings in the Commercial List of this court must understand that they need to proceed efficiently and without delay.Inexplicably, these proceedings have taken overfiveyears to come to trial.The justice of the circumstances are such that the consequences of LZI’s conduct should fall upon italone.ORDERSFor the reasons stated above, I propose to make the following orders:Order pursuant to r31.28of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW) refusing leave for the plaintiff to rely on theexpert report of Brad Mullard dated 29 July 2024.Otherwise dismiss the notice of motion filed 6 August 2024 by the plaintiff (Motion).Order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendant of the Motion.**********Amendments30 January 2025\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tAddition to case name: \"(No 3)\"DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

That definition adopts a“cash flow test\" of insolvency which turns upon the income sources available to the company and the expenditure obligations that it has to meet, although a balance sheet test can provide context for the application of the cash flow test:Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (inliq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation(2001) 53 NSWLR 213; (2001) 39 ACSR 305; [2001] NSWSC 621;Australian Securities and Investments Commission vPlymin(No 1)(2003) 175 FLR 124; (2003) 46 ACSR 126; [2003] VSC 123 at [370]ff(“Plymin”), aff'dElliott v Australian Securities and Investments Commission(2004) 10 VR 369; (2004) 48 ACSR 621; [2004] VSCA 54 and seeRe Swan Services Pty Limited (inliq)[2016] NSWSC 1724 at [136]ff;SX Projects Pty Ltd (inliq) v Battaglia[2018] NSWSC 1830 at [20]ff andRe Bias Boating Pty Limited (recs andmgrsapptd) (inliq)[2018] NSWSC 1977 at [4]ffandRe Custom Bus Australia Pty Limited (inliq)[2021] NSWSC 1036(“CustomBus”) at [33]ff, on which I have drawn for this summary of the applicable principles.InQuick vStolandPty Ltd(1998) 87 FLR 371; 157 ALR 615; (1998) 29 ACSR 130 at 138, Emmett J summarised the applicable principles as follows:“In order to determine whether the company was solvent at a given time, it would be relevant to consider the following matters:•All of the company's debts as at that time in order to determine when those debts were due and payable.•All of the assets of the company as at that time in order to determine the extent to which those assets were liquid or were realisable within a timeframe that would allow each of the debts to be paid as and when it became payable.•The company's business as at that time in order to determine its expected net cash flow from the business by deducting from projected future sales the cash expenses which would be necessary to generate those sales.•Arrangements between the company and prospective lenders, such as its bankers and shareholders, in order to determine whether any shortfall in liquid and realisable assets and cash flow could be made up by borrowings which would be repayable at a time later than the debts.”InRe BBY Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (inliq) and BBY Holdings Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (inliq)(2022) 409 ALR 558;[2022] NSWSC 29at [156], Gleeson JA observedthat:“A useful summary of principles for the determination of solvency for the purpose of s 95A was provided by Palmer J inSouthern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (inliq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation(2001) 53 NSWLR 213; [2001] NSWSC 621 at [54]. Several matters deserve repeating. Solvency or insolvency is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of the company’s financial position taken as a whole. An assessment of solvency requires regard to commercial realities when considering what resources are available to the company to meet its liabilities as they fall due, whether resources other than cash are realisable by sale or borrowing upon security, and whether such realisations are achievable. It is proper to have regard to the commercial reality that, in normal circumstances, creditors will not always insist on payment strictly in accordance with their terms of trade, but that does not result in the company thereby having a cash or credit resource which can be taken into account in determining solvency.”His Honour alsotherereferred to the“indicia of insolvency”to which Mandie J referred inPlyminand observed (at [162]-[164]) that:“The presence of one or more of the above indicia of insolvency is not necessarily conclusive of insolvency:PegulanFloor Coverings Pty Ltd v Carter(1997) 24 ACSR 651 at 655 (Doyle CJ). Nor is the absence of one or more of the above indicia inconsistent with the conclusion that a company is insolvent:ReAshingtonBayswater Pty Ltd (inliq)[2013] NSWSC 1008 at [5] (Black J).Where a liquidator is seeking to recover an unfair preference, the issue of solvency as at a date prior to the winding up necessitates an inquiry into what actually happened. Palmer J described this as ‘retrospective insolvency’ in Lewis v Doran at [108] when remarking:“Where the question is retrospective insolvency, the court has the inestimable benefit of the wisdom of hindsight. One can see the whole picture, both before, as at and after the alleged date of insolvency. The court will be able to see whether as at the alleged date of insolvency the company was, or was not, actually paying all of its debts as they fell due and whether it did, or did not, actually pay all those debts which, although not due as at the alleged date of insolvency, nevertheless became due at a time which, as a matter of commercial reality and common sense, had to be considered as at the date of insolvency. By reference to what actually happened, rather than to conflicting experts’ opinions as to the implications of balance sheets, the court’s task in assessing insolvency as at the alleged date should not be very difficult.The liquidator has the onus to prove that the company was insolvent at the relevant time(s):Welcome Homes Real Estate Pty Limited vZiadeInvestments Pty Limited[2007] NSWCA 167 at [40], [46(2)] and [70] (Hodgson JA,SpigelmanCJ and Santow JA agreeing); mere suspicion of insolvency cannot substitute for proof:M & R Jones Shopfitting Co Pty Ltd (inliq) v National Bank of Australasia Ltd(1983) 68 FLR 282 at 288-289; (1983) 7 ACLR 445 at 450-451 (WoottenJ).”I also summarised the applicable principles inCustom Bus(at [34]-[36])as follows:“The case law indicates that whether a company is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due and payable is a question of fact to be determined objectively and without hindsight in all the circumstances, including the nature of its assets and business, and the Court will have regard to commercial realities in that regard:Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (inliq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxationabove at [54];White Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (inliq) v White(2004) 49 ACSR 220 [2004] NSWSC 71 at [289];Lewis (as liquidator of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd) v Doran(2005) 219 ALR 555; (2005) 54 ACSR 410; [2005] NSWCA 243at [103];Bentley Smythe Pty Ltd v Anton Fabrications (NSW) Pty Ltd(2011) 248 FLR 384; [2011] NSWSC 186 at [48]–[49].In assessing a company’s capacity to pay its debts, the Court should have regard to all of the assets of the company as at the relevant time in order to determine the extent to which those assets were liquid or realisable within a timeframe that would allow each of the debts to be paid as and when they became due. Apart from an assessment of the company’s own assets, regard can also properly be had to funds which the company can borrow, on a secured or unsecured basis, or otherwise obtain from lenders or shareholders and which were, as a matter of commercial reality, available to the company to enable its debts to be paid. The case law recognises that, in determining a company’s solvency, the Court may have regard tothe likelihood that it will have funds available to it from sources with which it has noformalisedagreement or understanding, including loans from its directors or from third parties, at least if they are not repayable in the short term, andthe company's ability to borrow funds can also be taken into account:Lewis (as liquidator of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd) v Doranabove at [109]–[112];International Cat Manufacturing (inliq) v Rodrick(2013) 97 ACSR 200; [2013] QCA 372;First Strategic Development Corporation Ltd (inliq) v Chan[2014] QSC 60 at[67]–[69].The case law has recognised that, although each case is to be decided on its own facts, insolvent companies tend to share common symptoms of financial stress, which include those identified in[Plymin]at [386]. Mandie J there identified several indicia of insolvency including continuing losses; liquidity ratios below one; overdue Commonwealth and State taxes; a poor relationship with the lenders, including any inability to borrow further funds; no access to alternative finance; inability to raise further equity capital; suppliers placing a company on cash on delivery arrangements or otherwise demanding special payments before resuming supply; creditors unpaid outside trading terms; the issuing of postdated cheques; dishonoured cheques; special arrangements with selected creditors; solicitors’ letters, summonses, judgments or warrants issued against a company; payments to creditors of rounded sums not reconcilable to specific invoices; and inability to produce timely and accurate financial information to display a company’s trading performance and financial position, and make reliable forecasts; see alsoMorris vDanozDirections Pty Ltd (inliq) (No 2)[2010] FCA 836 at [13].”InRe Harmony Homes Pty Ltd (inliq) (No 2)[2023] NSWSC 816(“Harmony Homes”)at [5],Ball Jreferred to the judgment of Barrett J inSutherland & Anor as joint liquidators of Australian Coal Technology v Hanson Construction Materials Pty Ltd[2009] NSWSC 232 at [8]-[9] and noted that s 95A of theActcalls attention principally to the cashflow test of insolvency, with subsidiary relevance to the balance sheet test. Ball J there identified several factual matters which established thatcompany’s insolvency, namely that company’s liquidity ratio (that is, the ratio ofitscurrent assets overitscurrent liabilities) was significantly less than one during the whole of theRelation-Back Periodand was trending downwards; that company had no capacity to borrow money or to raise additional capital; that company suffered significant trading losses over theRelation-Back Period; that company had overdue Commonwealth and State taxes which had increased over the period and had defaulted on a number of occasions on payment arrangements it had reached with the Australian Taxation Office(“ATO”); suppliers had placed that company on cash delivery terms and a number of suppliers had demanded payment, threatenedto commence proceedings or commenced proceedings, and substantial amounts owed to trade creditors were more than 3 months overdue; that company had made a substantial number of rounded payments to creditors that cannot be reconciled to the payment of specific debts; andthat companywas unable to produce timely and accurate information concerning its financial position.Affidavit and otherevidenceThe Plaintiffs read the affidavit dated 8 March 2024 of Mr WilliamHonner, who is a registered liquidator working with Messrs Carter, Walley and Scott in the liquidations of Co-Op and Co Info. MrHonnerthere outlined his involvement in the investigations into the affairs of Co-Op and Co Info. MrHonneroutlined the history of Co-Op and Co info and noted that, as a non-distributing co-operative, Co-Op was prohibited from giving returns or distributions on any surplus or share capital to members, other than nominal value of any shares, and that prohibition made it impossible to obtain equity investment directly into Co-Op, as it would not be possible to provide investors with any return on that investment. He also noted that the liquidators had identified no evidence that Co-Op had sought or obtained any equity investment at any time. Plainly, that matter limited the fund raising options that were available to Co-Op.MrHonneralso summarised the position in respect of the books and records of Co-Op and referred to difficulties with the accounting and inventory management systems used by Co-Op, which adversely affected the reliability of the financial information recorded in Co-Op’s records, and notes that issues as to the reliability of thatinformation had previously been identified by the auditors of Co-Op. MrHonneralso addressed the position as toCo Info’s books and records, where less information was available to the liquidators as a result of thepriorsale of Co Info’s business.MrHonneralso addressed the provision of information to Mr Olde who had prepared an expert report on which the Plaintiffs rely to establish the insolvency of Co-Op and Co Info.He also referred to several secondary analysesprepared by the liquidators, which were provided to Mr Olde to assist with the preparation of his expert report. MrHonner’sevidence (Honner, [68]) is that, in some instances, he and theliquidators formed the view that there are deficiencies in the information or data drawn from the primary documents; in other instances, they otherwise considered that further context or explanation was required, or that the information could be presented in a more convenient fashion; and that:“In light of this, PwC prepared the following secondary documents. These are secondary documents in the sense that they have been created using data from primary documents, or they index or list primary documents or they have been produced to more conveniently collate or summarise voluminous data from primary documents…”MrHonneralso addressed the payment termsin respect ofcreditors of Co-Op and Co Info and noted that Co-Op largely undertook retail sales and did not offer credit, with the exception of a small number of customers, and that Co Info primarily traded with two customers which comprised the very large part of its trade debtors throughout theRelation-Back Period. MrHonneralso outlined the facilities available to Co-Op from its secured lender, National Australia Bank (“NAB”),and his evidence was that Co Info also lent substantial funds to Co-Op during theRelation-BackPeriod and prior to that time. He referred to correspondence in respect of the sale of the assets of Co Info and referred to attempts to sell other assets of Co-Op in the relevant time, including attempts to sellitsbusiness previously trading under the name“Australian Geographic”, and then underthename“Curious Planet”after Co-Op lost the right to use the“Australian Geographic”name.MrHonnernotedthree indicative offers received by Co-Op in respect of the potential sale of that business, two of which involved no or a nominalconsiderationand the third of which involved a suggested payment of $29.5 million. MrHonneridentifies matters which raise a real question as to whether that third offer was genuine, and it is plain that the potential purchaserwho made that third indicative offer took no active steps to advance a purchase of the business andshowed no interest in continuing with the purchase of that business after the companies were placed in voluntary administration. It is not necessary to reach a finding as to that matter in orderto determine the question of Co Op’s and Co Info’ssolvency in theRelation-Back Period.MrHonneralso addressed the circumstances in which Co-Oplostthe right to use the“Australian Geographic”trademark, by reason of its failure to pay amounts due under a licence agreement in respect of that trademark.He alsoreferred to the audit of Co-Op for the year ended 30 June 2019, which had identified significant issues, and to asset realisations which had been achieved by the voluntary administrators and liquidators during the voluntary administration and liquidation.MrHonnerexhibited a substantial volume of documentsto hisaffidavit (Ex P1)and, in submissions, MrKrochmaliktook me to numerous documents which are consistent with a finding that bothCo-Opand Co Infor were insolvent in theRelation-Back Period, andthe Plaintiffs subsequently provided a chronologicallistingof that evidence. I focus here on the documents within the Relation-BackPeriod from 25 May 2019onward.Between27and29May2019, email exchanges between SBGPty Ltd (“SBG”)(a creditorof Co-Op) and Co-Op(ExP6,1-7) recorded debts owing to SBG of over $184,000 of which over $88,500 was over 90 days due and discussed a possible payment plan andMr Chen,Co-Op’s Head of Finance,advisedits Chief Executive Officerthatmorethan 40supplierswere wanting old invoices paid and suggested seeking a discount of 3-5% from suppliers if the amounts due were cleared by withdrawing $500,000 to $1 million from the NAB facility; the chief executive officer responded that he wasreluctantto borrow more from NAB unless thew Co-Op had to since it would be a“struggle”to pay back existing borrowings.Between27May2019and20June2019, email exchanges between United Book Distributors (a creditor) and Co-Opaddressed amounts unpaid to that supplier (ExP6,15-21).By an emaildated 5 June 2019 (Ex P1,CB1517), MrChensent theCo-OpandCo Info boardthe 2020 budget paper including a2020 Budget & Strategy Reportwhich recorded substantial declines in textbook sales in the 2019financial year, representing up to $40 million in lost revenue, andforecastinga loss after tax in that year, and noting that 40% of Co-Op’s stores were projected to fall into loss in FY2020 creating urgency to consider“alternative futures”. The CEO report contained in that document also recorded declining sales revenue, with a 27% decrease over the previous year, reflecting reduced textbook sales and closed stores.In early June 2019, Co-Op received a demand for payment(Ex P1,CB5279)undertheTrade Mark Licence Agreementwhich authorised it to use the“Australian Geographic”trade mark. It did not pay that amount resulting in the loss of its right tousethat trade mark. About the same time, there was correspondence (Ex P6, 9-13) withMcGraw-Hill,a creditor, about amounts due and unpaid to it. On12June2019, Mr Chen advised MrLee, Co-Op’s formerHead of Finance, of his having raised the risk of insolvency and issues of directors’duties in that respect with theChiefExecutiveOfficer (Ex P6,8). In late June and the first half of July, there were further exchanges betweenThomson Reuters, anothercreditor and Co-Opabout unpaid trade debts (Ex P6,24-41)and, between late June and late September, email exchanges between Cengage (a creditor, and theFirstDefendant) and Co-Op(Ex P1,CB4739) and, in July 2019, email exchanges between Oxford University Press (alsoa creditor, and theFourthDefendant) and Co-Op(ExP6,43-47).Email exchanges in mid-July 20129 (Ex P1,CB4728) also referred to the transfer of funds from Co Info to Co-Op, with the amount transferred limited by Co Info’s need to meet short term payment obligations.On 12 September 2019, NAB advised Co-Op(Ex P1,CB3697) of breach of several obligations under its Finance Agreement, includingCo-Op’s obligation to pay down part of the NAB debt on specified debts (“NAB Clean-Down obligation”) and advised that NAB did not waive its rights as to those breaches but would be taking no action at that time.TheAudit Completion Reportas to the Co-Op for the yearended 30 June 2019(Ex P1,CB1632), issued in November2019, noted that Co-Op’s net current asset position of $8.3 million was primarily attributable to the classification ofassets for sale as current assets, including the Curious Planet business at $29.5 million by reference to a non-binding letter of offer, and I have noted an issue as to whether that offer was genuine above and, consequentially, whether that classification was genuine. That audit report notedcash balances were not appropriately reconciled resulting in an adjustment of $1.2 million and other reconciliation issues, and Co-Op’s balance sheet would have shown substantial negative assets but for the valuation attributed to the Curious Planet business.Other errors that had overstated Co-Op’s financial position were also corrected by a retrospective restatement. The Plaintiffs do not rely on these matters for any presumption of insolvency arising from a failure to keep adequate financial records, but rightly note that less weight can be given to the recorded assets position of Co-Op by reason of these matters.Plainly, these documentstend tosupport a finding the each ofCo-Opand Co Info were insolvent in theRelation-Back Period.The Plaintiffs also read the affidavit dated 11 March 2024 of Mr Quentin Olde, who has extensive experienceas an insolvency practitionerandhasprepared an expert report(Ex P2)as to Co-Op’s and Co Info’s solvency in theRelation-Back Periodandthereconfirmed his compliance with the Expert Witness Code of Conduct in respect of that report. I have drawn below on MrKrochmalik’sdetailed summary of this report. None of the Defendants to the proceedings contested the conclusions reached by Mr Olde, and MsBeechey, who appeared for the First defendant at this hearing, did not seek to cross-examine Mr Olde or make submissions contrary to the conclusions which he had reached.Mr Olde concluded that Co-Op was insolvent from at least 31 March 2019onwards, and duringthe whole of the Relation-Back Period.First, Mr Oldetested whether Co-Op could pay its immediately due and payable debts on various test dates for which he had available information on three alternate scenarios. The first(“Scenario 1”)disregardedtheNAB Clean-down obligation and debts labelled 90 days and greater within Co-Op’s accounts payable reports as immediately due and payable, where the trading terms of Co-Op’stop ten suppliers were on average 54 days; the second(“Scenario 2”)modified that approach to take the NAB Clean-down obligation into account; and the third(Scenario 3”)removed debts that were potentially subject to a payment plan at the relevant test date, although Mr Olde noted that that Co-Op regularly failed to adhere to payment plans it entered into in 2019.Mr Olde concludes and I accept that, under each of Scenarios 2 and 3, Co-Op had insufficient liquidity to pay its immediately due and payable debts on each test date from 31 March 2019 to November 2019 and, under Scenario 1, Co-Op had insufficient liquidity to pay its immediately due and payable debts on each test date from 6 May 2019 to November 2019.Mr Oldealso notesthat, in apparent breach of the terms of the NAB Facilities, Co-Op failed to meet the NAB Clean-down obligation as at 31 March 2019, with $6 million remaining drawn on the facility throughout April 2019, and again failed to meet the obligation as at 31 August 2019.Second, Mr Olde calculated Co-Op’s liquidity ratios fromthe informationavailable to him on an adjusted and unadjusted basis from September 2014 onwards.He noted that a“Current Ratio calculation”, being the ratio ofCurrent Assets/Current Liabilities,enables an assessment of a company’s ability to discharge its current liabilities from its current assets, and aCurrent Ratio less than 1 shows the company has more current liabilities than current assets, indicating it would have difficulty paying its debts as and when they fall due.A“Quick Ratio calculation”, being the ratio of(Current Assets–Inventory) / Current Liabilities,is more short-term focused as it removes inventory from the calculation, and focusseson a company’s ability to pay its debts over a shorter time period, typically 90 days.Mr Olde expresses the view that, if a company’s Quick Ratio is less than 1, this indicates that a company does not have enough quick assets (such as cash and debtors) to meet all its short-term obligations and may have difficulty pay its debts as and when they fall due.Mr Olde’s calculatesthatCo-Op had a Quick Ratio and Quick Ratio (accounts payable only) below 1 at all times between September 2014andNovember 2019 when considering the unadjusted balance sheets and adjusted balance sheets; Co-Op had a Current Ratio below 1 at all times between July 2019andNovember 2019 when considering the unadjusted balance sheets; and Co-Op had a Current Ratio below 1 at all times between August 2017andNovember 2019 when considering the adjusted balance sheets, with that ratio decreasing from 0.91 at March 2019 to 0.71 at November 2019.On that basis,Mr Olde concludes thatCo-Op would have difficulty paying its debts as and when they fell due at each month end date from September 2017 to November 2019;this viewwas reinforcedfrom July 2019,when Co-Op’sCurrent Ratio (on an unadjusted balance sheet basis) fellbelow 1 and remainedbelowthat figureuntil November 2019; andCo-Op’slack of liquidity to pay immediately due and payable debts as at each test date was permanent and persistent (rather than being temporary) from 31 March 2019.Third, Mr Olde considered Co-Op’s trading performance in the context of the cash flow test, and noted thatCo-Op had ongoing monthly losses from March 2019 to October 2019, witha cumulative loss ofabout. $14.1 million over this period,anda profitof$557,000recorded in November 2019. Mr Oldeexpressesthe view that Co-Op’s ongoing trading losses from March 2019 to October 2019, from a“Cash Flow Test”perspective, further inhibiteditsability to pay its immediately due and payable debts (utilising cash flow from trading activities) as at eachtestdate from 31 March 2019 and onwards.Fourth, Mr Olde considered whether Co-Op may have alternate or other sources of finance available to itand concludedthat the primary and material sources of liquidity for Co-Op to pay immediately due and payable debts were the immediate sources he had already taken into account.Fifth, Mr Oldeobservedthat Co-Op experienced increasing evidence of theseveralindicators of insolvencynoted inPlyminsince at least March 2019, including that,from at least June 2019, some of Co-Op’s creditors placed Co-Op’s account on hold and/or demanded prepayment on new purchase orders prior to delivery; from October 2018, Co-Op entered into a payment arrangement with one creditor and, from at least April 2019, Co-Op regularly entered into such arrangements with significant creditors; Co-Op failedto satisfy the terms of some of these payment arrangements;andCo-Op had a poor relationship with its bank, NAB, from at least September 2019.Thesefindings are consistent with the documentary evidence to which I referred above.Mr Oldedid not find that Co-Op was insolvent on abalance sheet test over theRelation-Back Period, but observed that he gave little to no weight tothat matter where earlier audits and his review had identifieddeficiencies with respect to Co-Op’sfinancialrecordsanda lack of controls and procedures with respect to balance sheet reconciliations (including cash account reconciliations) which in turn would impact the accuracy of those accounts; andthe balancesheettest didnot consider the timing of and ability to realise assets, recoverable values of assets and whether the balance sheet of a company considers all assets and all liabilities.Mr Olde noted that these factorswere significantforCo-Op,whereits net asset position was primarily supported by a substantial inventory and intangible asset (primarily goodwill) balance.I also give little weight to that finding for those reasons.Mr Oldealsoconcluded that Co Info was insolvent from at least 31 March 2019and forthe whole of the Relation-Back Period.Mr Oldeagaintested whether Co Info could pay its immediately due and payable debts on test dates for which he had availableinformationon threealternate scenarios, as to when debts wereconsidered immediately due and payable.Mr Oldehere noted thatthe only source of liquidity potentially available to Co Info that could be utilised to pay immediately due and payable debts in the period from April 2018 to November 2019wascash at bank, since its intercompanyloanto Co-Opwasplainlynot recoverable and could not have been relied on as a source of liquidity to pay Co Info’sdebts,whereCo-Op had insufficient cash at bank to repay theintercompanyloan in full (before considering any of Co-Op’s other payment obligations) at all month-end dates between April 2018 and November 2019,except July 2018.Mr Olde concludes that,underthe first and third of those scenarios, Co Info had insufficient liquidity to pay its immediately due and payable debts on each test date from 31 March 2019 to November 2019 and, underthe second scenario,which he considers less relevant for reasons that he explains,Co Info hadinsufficient liquidity to pay its immediately due and payable debts on each test date from 30 April 2019 to November 2019 (with the exception of small surpluses at 30 June 2019 and 31 July 2019).Mr Oldealsocalculated Co Info’s Quick Ratio and Current Ratio from April 2018 onand concludes thatCo Info would have difficulty paying its debts as and when they fell due at each month-end date from April 2018 to August 2019 given that it had liquidity ratios below 1 on an adjusted balance sheet basis;from July 2019, itsposition became worsewhen itsCurrent Ratio (on an unadjusted balance sheet basis) fellbelow 1;afterthe business of Co Info was sold in September 2019, Co Info had insufficient cash and debtors to repay its remaining liabilities in full; andthatlack of liquidity to pay immediately due and payable debts as at each test date was permanent and persistent (rather than being temporary) from 31 March 2019.Third,Mr Oldefinds, and I accept, that, based on his review of Co-Op’s financial performance, Co Info was unable to raise equity from Co-op and could not rely on equity funding to pay immediately due and payable debts from at least January 2019. Fourth, Mr Oldenotesthat Co Infoexhibited severalof the indicators of insolvencynoted inPlyminfrom March 2019.Mr Olde also noted that, althoughCo Info recorded ongoing monthly profits between April 2018andNovember 2019 (except finOctober 2019),the factthat Co Info’scashwas regularly divertedto Co-Opunder the intercompany loan left it withlimited cash to pay its own immediately due and payable debts,where the balance of the intercompanyloanaccountcould not be repaid by Co-Op.Mr Olde also addressed Co-Op’s balance sheet position.In summary,Mr Olde’s reportprovidesa detailed analysis of the applicationof thecashflow test to each of Co-Op and Co Info, giving primary weight to the position in respect of trade debts by Co-Op where the evidence does not indicate that its taxation and statutory obligations or employee obligations were overdue; his review ofthe liquidity position of Co-Opon thethree alternativescenarios that I noted aboveestablishesthat, on any reasonable view,Co-Opwas unable to pay its debts as and when they fell due;and Co Info was alsounable to meet its debts when they fell due onthe threescenariosthat Mr Olde addressed, particularly where the amounts it had paid to Co-Op by way of loan were plainly not recoverable.These matters, combined with the documentary evidence to which I referred above, establish the insolvency of both Co-Op and Co Info during the Relation-BackPeriod.The Plaintiffs read an affidavit dated 7 August 2024 of their solicitor, Mr Gallego, who referred to correspondence with Lake Press, which, as I noted abovehad not admitted the insolvency of Co-Op and Co Info and, in effect, put the Plaintiffs to proof of that matter, although there had been without prejudice discussions between the Plaintiffs and Lake Press as to the possibility of settlement of the proceedings. The relevant correspondence was contained in an exhibit to Mr Gallego’s affidavit (Ex P3).The Plaintiffs also tendered correspondence with other Defendants which admitted the insolvency of Co-Op and Co Info during theRelation-Back Periodor, in one case, had at least made clear that they did not contest the fact of those entities’insolvency (Ex P4 for the former; Ex P5 for the latter).The Plaintiffs also tendered correspondence by which executives of Co-Op had recognised financial difficulties facing the companies in the period prior to the appointment of voluntary administrators (Ex P6)and an extract from the transcript of theChiefFinancialOfficer of Co-Op, who had also recognised the prospect of insolvencyin mid-2019 and had drawn that matter to the attention of the chief executive of Co-Op.DeterminationTheevidenceto which I have referred above is sufficient to establishbothCo-Op’s and Co Info’sinsolvency intheRelation-Back PeriodwhereCo-Op’sasset position deteriorated from before theRelation-Back Periodto a significant deficiency in theRelation-Back Period;Co-Op’sand Co Info’sliquidity ratio (that is, the ratio ofitscurrent assets overitscurrent liabilities) was significantly less than1during theRelation-Back Period;Co-Opand Co Info wereunable topaytheirtrade debtson a timely basisthroughout theRelation-Back Period;Co-Ophaddefaulted on payment arrangements it had reached withseveral tradecreditors in that period;andCo-Opand Co Infohad noapparentcapacity toborrow money or to raise additional capital.By reason of these matters,Iam satisfied that, during the whole of theRelation-Back Period,each ofCo-Opand Co Infocould not meet debts then due to its creditors andeach ofCo-Opand Co Infowas insolvent throughout the whole of theRelation-Back Period.OrdersFor these reasons, I find thateach ofCo-Opand Co Infowas insolvent, within the meaning of s 95A of theAct, for the whole of theRelation-Back Period.I willreserve the costs of the application, which may best be determined after the determination of any remaining issues in the proceedings.

At that time, Mr Liu was the sole shareholder of Mamae, and Mr Liu and Ms Shelley were the directors of Mamae.From around 25 March 2010, Mr Liu and Ms Shelley became equal shareholders in Mamae.Mamae was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring a property located at XXX in New South Wales (theProperty).Mr Liu deposes that he and Ms Shelley agreed in about early 2010 that each would contribute 50 per cent of the money required to purchase the Property, on the basis that each would be entitled to a half share in the Property, including a half share in any rental income.Mr Liu also deposes that, at the time of this agreement,the Property was being leased toInterconnectPty Ltd. Ms Shelley’s husband, Mr Phillip Shelley, was a director and shareholder of Interconnect.On 6 May 2010, Mamae became registered proprietor of the Property.Documents produced by Ms Shelley in answer to aNotice toProduce in these proceedings include trust deeds dated 3 March 2010 and 3 March 2012 for the“Liu Family Trust”(Trust), which name Mamae as trustee of the Trust. Mr Liu deposesthat prior to the production of these documents, he was not aware that the Trust had been established or that Mamae was the trustee of any trust. Having regard to this material,Senior Counsel for Mr Liu noted thatthere may be an issue regarding whether Mamae held theproperty in its own right, oras trustee for the beneficiaries of the Trust, or on trust for Mr Liu and Ms Shelley (having regard to the matters in paragraph 7 above).I do not need to resolve that issue for the purposes of this application.Onaround10 January 2012, Ms Shelley lodged a form with the Third Defendant (ASIC), certifying that Mr Liu ceased to be a director of Mamae from 2 January 2012. Mr Liu deposed that he cannot now recall whether or not he agreed to thisoccurring, orwas informed that this form had been lodged.However, Mr Liuacknowledgedthat Ms Shelley was solely responsible for managing the affairs of Mamae and the Property.Between September and November 2021, Mr Liu and Ms Shelley exchanged emails in relation to Mamae and the Property. It is not necessary to go into the details of that correspondence. In short, Mr Liu sought information in relation to Mamae and the Property; Ms Shelley did not provide this material and indicated that she intended to cease managing the affairs of Mamae; and Mr Liu indicated that he could find someone else to manage Mamae. In response,Ms Shelley indicated to Mr Liu that she intended to“transfer [her] half out”, following which Mr Liu would“have 100% Mamae”. Mr Liu asked for details of her proposal and indicated that he did not consent to Ms Shelley disposing of any assets of Mamae until the issues between them had been resolved.On 1 March 2022, Mamae transferred the Property to the Second Defendant,QD TradingPty Ltd. The directors and shareholders of QD Trading are Ms Shelley and Mr Shelley.The registered transfer of the Property indicates thatnilconsideration was paid.On 30 April 2022, Mr Liu received an email from Ms Shelleywhich stated as follows:“I have sold [XXX address] for 1.7m, $850k belong to you, I will transfer $700K plus last year rental $24,807 to you this week. 150k I will hold until tax return 2022 done. I will finalize rest balance in august this year.”Mr Liu deposes that between 2 and 9 May 2022, he receiveda total of$724,807 from Ms Shelley, which he understood to be payments in respect of the transfer of the Property.There is evidence that, prior to transferring the Property for nil consideration and informing Mr Liu that it had been sold for $1.7m, Ms Shelley had received an appraisal report dated 30 July 2021, which valued the Property at between $2.4m and $2.5m. Ms Shelley emailed this valuation to Mr Liu at 5.50pm on 2 August 2021, and then attempted to recall that email at 6.03pm. Following this, she sent him a further email at 6.07pm, which attached an appraisal from the same entity,dated 2 August 2021,valuing the Property at between $1.7m and $2.0m. The relationship between the two valuation reports is unexplained.On 10 August 2022, Ms Shelley lodged with ASIC an application for voluntary deregistration of Mamae pursuant to s 601AA of the Act. This application included a declaration by Ms Shelley that all members of Mamae agreed to the deregistration. Mr Liu deposes that Ms Shelley did not seek or obtain his consent or approval to lodge the form; that he did not agree to the deregistration of Mamae; and that he was not aware of its deregistration until around March 2023.On 12 October 2022, Mamae was deregistered.Mr Liu has estimated that, from the timeMamaepurchased the Property (when Interconnect was a tenant) until the time of its deregistration, Mamae received or was entitled to receive rental income of around $1.6m. He sets out in his affidavit the basis ofthis estimate.Mr Liudeposes that, based on his review of his own financial statements, Ms Shelley has caused him to be paid only $91,356 on account of rental income.The position of the DefendantsAt the start of the hearing, Senior Counsel for Mr Liu mentioned the matter on behalf of the solicitor for Ms Shelley and QD Tradingand handed up proposedshort minutes of order,which were signed by the solicitor for Ms Shelley and QD Trading. Those proposed consent ordersprovidedfor the reinstatement of Mamae; notedMs Shelley’s agreement to resignas director of Mamaeupon its reinstatement; providedfor Mr Liu and MrSiyuanLiu (who is the nephew of Mr Liu and Ms Shelley) to be appointed as directors of Mamae; and reservedcosts as against Ms Shelley and QD Trading.Mr Liualsotendered correspondence from ASIC, confirming that ASIC’s position was that it did not oppose the application and would not attend the hearing on the condition that no order for costs would be sought against ASIC (and no such order has been sought).Relevant PrinciplesSection 601AH of the Actrelevantlyprovides as follows:(2)The Court may make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of a company if:(a)an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by:(i)a person aggrieved by the deregistration;…(b)the Court is satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated.(3) If:…(b)the Court makes an order under subsection (2);the Court may:…(d)make any other order it considers appropriate.…(5)If a company is reinstated, the company is taken to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered. A person who was a director of the company immediately before deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company. Any property of the company that is still vested in the Commonwealth or ASIC revests in the company. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the company takes the property subject to that interest or claim.The principles relevant to reinstatement applications were conveniently summarised byMcGrath J inthe recent decision ofYi Li v Australian Securities and Investments Commission[2024] NSWSC 514 at [25] as follows:“(1)The question whether an applicant under s 601AH(2) is a‘person aggrieved by the deregistration’is considered by reference to legal rights and legal interests:Arnold World Trading Pty Ltd v ACN 133 427 335 Pty Ltd[2010] NSWSC 1369; (2010) 80 ACSR 670, Barrett J at [43], approved inRe LCW Property Holdings Ltd (deregistered)[2020] NSWSC 71, Gleeson J at [17].(2)The concept of a‘person aggrieved by the deregistration’includes a person who has a genuine grievance because a company’s dissolution has extinguished a right of some value or potential value, including a right to bring proceedings against the company or to bring a claim by the company against a third party:ReLikehartPty Ltd (deregistered)[2017] NSWSC 884, Black J at [18];LCW Propertyat [21];In the matter of Human Group Pty Ltd; In the matter of A.C.N. 137 384 662 Pty Ltd[2023] NSWSC 28, Black J at [7].(3)The question of whether it is just that the company’s registration be reinstated involves a broad discretionary judgment of the court, the relevant considerations for which include the circumstances in which it was deregistered, the purpose of the person aggrieved in seeking its reinstatement, whether any person is likely to be prejudiced by its reinstatement and the public interest generally:Re ERB International Pty Ltd (deregistered)(2014) 283 FLR 223; [2014] NSWSC 200, Brereton J at [5]; LCW Property at [16] and [22]–[28];Human Groupat [9].(4)On an application for reinstatement, the court is concerned with the justice of reinstating the company, not the justice of any proceedings which it is proposed that the reinstated company might institute or resume:ERB International at[10] citing the Victorian Court of Appeal inAMP General Insurance Ltd v VictorianWorkCoverAuthority[2006] VSCA 236 at [35]; applied inLCW Propertyat [22].(5)It is often not appropriate in an application for reinstatement to go into factual matters which may be the subject of dispute:Pilarinosv Australian Securities and Investments Commission[2006] VSC 301; (2006) 24 ACLC 775, Gillard J at [22];DeputyCmrof Taxation vAustralian Securities and Investments Commission; Re Civic Finance Pty Ltd (deregistered)[2010] FCA 1411; (2010) 81 ATR 456, Jagot J at [14], applied inLCW Propertyat [20].(6)The effect of reinstatement is that the former directors and secretary automatically resume office as directors and secretary of the company by reason of the operation of s 601AH(5) of the Corporations Act:LCW Propertyat [27], citingMitzevv Foxman[2007] NSWCA 273, Basten JA (Tobias and McColl JJA agreeing) at [25].(7)The power of the court in s 601AH(3)(d) of the Corporations Act to‘make any other order it considers appropriate’must be exercised having regard toall ofthe circumstances of the particular case and the broader context of the operation of the Corporations Act:FederalCmrof Taxation vIannuzzi(No 3)[2024] FCA 45, Markovic J at [215].”The expression“person aggrieved”is of wide import and is to be construed liberally:Owners of Strata Plan No 91349 v AustralianSecurities andInvestmentCommission[2020] NSWSC 685 at [61] (Bell P). What must be shown is that the plaintiff has a genuine grievance because the deregistration has extinguished a right of some value or potential value, such as a right, potentially, to bring a claim by the company against a third party:In the matter ofLikehartPty Ltd (deregistered)[2017] NSWSC 884 at [18] (Black J);In the matter of LCW Property Holdings Pty Ltd (deregistered)[2020] NSWSC 71 at [20]-[21](Gleeson JA).Where reinstatement isfor the purpose of pursuing legal proceedings,the Court should notengage in too close a scrutiny of the claims or theirstrength; theclaims must be shown to have“some level of arguability”, but the threshold is“very low”:Owners of Strata Plan No 91349 vAustralian Securities and Investment Commissionat [88] (Bell P).ConsiderationI am satisfied that a basis has been established for the making of an order to reinstate Mamae.Mr Liu submitted that he was a“person aggrieved”by thederegistrationof Mamae for two principal reasons:first,the deregistration of Mamae occurred without Mr Liu’s consent and, as a result, he lost the ability to bring a shareholder oppression claim in relation to Ms Shelley’s management of the affairs of Mamae; andsecondly, by the deregistration of Mamae, he lost the ability to bring a derivative claim in the name of the companyagainst Ms Shelley and/or QD Tradingin respect of the transfer of the Property at an undervalue or in respect of any failure to collect commercial rent in respect of the Property.I do not need to determine the strength of those claims. I accept that,on the basis ofthe evidence that Mr Liu has put forward on this applicationwhich I have summarised above, those claimshavea sufficientlevel of arguabilityto meet the low threshold on such an application. Accordingly,I accept Mr Liu’s submission that he is a person aggrieved by the deregistration of Mamae, having lost a right of some potential value.Theevidencebeforethe Court does not provide a basis for concluding that, upon reinstatement, Mamae would be insolvent. In particular:as at the time of applying for deregistration of Mamae, the sole director, Ms Shelley,made a declaration that,among other things, Mamae was not carrying on any business, had paid all fees and penalties payable under the Act, had no outstanding liabilities, and was not a party to any legal proceedings;the most recent financial statements of Mamae“ATF Liu Family Trust”which are available, and which were signed by Ms Shelley, are those asat30 June 2021. These financial statements indicate that Mamae’s assets were approximately equal to its current and non-current liabilities, and that Mamae’s income exceeded its expensesfor that financial year; andatax return which was preparedin respect ofMamaeas trustee of the Trustfor the financial year ending 30 June 2022 (and which is marked as its“final tax return”, on the basis that Mamae has“ceased business”) records that Mamae had no current liabilities and no trade creditors.Pursuant to s 601AH(5), upon reinstatement of Mamae, Ms Shelley, who was its sole director, will become its director.As I have already noted above, Ms Shelley hasindicated, in the signed consent orders, heragreement andintentionto resign as director of Mamae upon its reinstatement. It is therefore necessary to appoint directors to Mamae.The Court has power to make orders appointing directors to the company upon its reinstatement pursuant to its power under s 601AH(3)(d):In the matter ofGarfox86 Pty Ltd[2019] NSWSC 442 at [20]-[25](Rees J);Nicholls (Trustee)v AustralianSecuritiesand Investments Commission, in the matter of Lawson[2023] FCA 1368 at [20]-[21] (Halley J).Mr Liu is willing to be appointedasa director of Mamae upon its reinstatement.MrSiyuan (Simon)Liu, who is the nephew of Mr Liu and Ms Shelley, has affirmed an affidavit confirming that he isalsowilling to be appointedasa director of Mamae upon its reinstatement, that he will not charge any fees to carry out his duties as a director andthat hewill not cause Mamae to trade or incur any liabilities which it cannot meet. MrSiyuanLiuis ordinarily resident in Australia and consents to his residential address being used as Mamae’s registered address.Ms Shelley and QD Trading have consented to the proposed orders appointing Mr Liu and MrSiyuanLiu as directors ofMamae, andchanging the registered address of the company to MrSiyuanLiu’s address.In addition, Mr Liuproffered, by hisCounsel,an undertaking to the Court that upon reinstatement of Mamae, he will pay on behalf of Mamae, and also indemnify Mamae with respect to,registration fees and other fees payable byMamae to ASIC; any fees, disbursements or costs incurred by Mamae with respect to any proceedings commenced by Mr Liu in the name of Mamae against Ms Shelley and QD Trading; and any adverse costs order made against Mamae with respect to such proceedings.In circumstances where the person who was sole director of Mamae, Ms Shelley, has indicated her intention to resign as a director upon its reinstatement;where the only shareholders of Mamae were Ms Shelley and Mr Liu;whereit is proposed that Mr Liu and the nephew of both Mr Liu and Ms Shelleybe appointed as Mamae’sdirectorsupon its reinstatement;where Ms Shelley consents to orders effecting those appointments;and where Mr Liu hasproffered theundertakingoutlined above, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise the power under s 601AH(3)(d) toorder that those appointments be made.Finally, the material before the Court does not suggest that there is any public interest factor against reinstatement.As I have noted above,the evidence does not suggestthat Mamae will be insolvent upon its reinstatement;I have referred above to theterms of theundertakingprofferedby Mr Liuand the matters affirmed by Mr Simon Liu in his affidavit;thepersonsmost likely to be affected by reinstatement (Ms Shelley and QD Trading) consent to the proposed orders; andASIC does not oppose reinstatement.OrdersFor the reasons given above, I make the following orders.The Court orders that the Third Defendantis ordered to reinstate the registration of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 376 609).The Court notes the First Defendant’s intention to resign as director of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 376 609)upon its reinstatement.The Court orders that upon the reinstatement of the registration of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 376 609), the Third Defendant:record Wen Qi Liu and Siyuan Liu as directors of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 376 609); andrecord XXX as the registered office of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 376 609).There be no order as to costs against the Third Defendant.Costs as against the First and Second Defendants are reserved to the shareholder oppression proceedings and/or derivative action proceedings foreshadowed in this application by the Plaintiff against the First and Second Defendants.Liberty to restore on 3 days’notice.The Court notes the undertaking by the Plaintiff to the Court that, upon reinstatement of the registration of Mamae Pty Ltd (ACN 142 367 609) (Mamae), he will pay on behalf of,and alsoindemnify Mamae with respect to:registration fees and any other fees payable by Mamae to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission;any fees, disbursements, or costs incurred by Mamae with respect to any proceedings commenced by the Plaintiff in the name of Mamae against the First and Second Defendants; andany adverse order as to costs made against Mamae with respect to the proceedings referred to in paragraph (b) above.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

I note that as a forensic patient the defendant is“a person under legal incapacity”: s 3Civil Procedure Act 2005(NSW).As such,r7.14 of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW)requires the appointment of a tutor to carryon the proceedings.In the event,the defendant was present at the hearing (appearingbyaudiovisual link (“AVL”)). The hearing was paused on occasion to allow him to speak with his solicitor with respect to the conduct of the matter. Thedefendant’stutor was also present at the hearing, alsoby AVL.The proceedings brought by the Attorney-GeneralThe defendant was, in May 2020,charged with aggravated sexual assault of apersonunder his authority, contrary to s 61J(1) of theCrimes Act 1900(NSW). He was found unfit to be tried and a special hearing was held under the Act. At that hearing, Trail DCJfound that, on the limited evidence available, the defendant had committed the offence charged. Her Honour imposed a limiting term of 4 years commencing on 28 May 2020. This had the result of designating the defendant a“forensic patient”, as defined in s 72 of the Act.As a forensic patient the defendant was subject to periodic review by the Mental Health Review Tribunal (“MHRT”). Following areview,hewas released during the currency of his limiting term, on 8 November 2023. He remained a forensic patient but was in the community subject to the conditions on his release imposed by theMHRT.Whilst in the community as a forensic patient the defendant is subject to the supervision of the Community Safety Program (“CSP”).The plaintiff’s summons as originally filed soughtan order that the defendant be subject to an interim order for the extension of his status as a forensic patientfor three monthstogether with ordersappointing two qualifiedpsychiatrists, registered psychologists or medical practitioners (or a combination of such persons)to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant;to furnish reports to the Court on the results of those examinations;and directing the defendant to attend those examinations.A preliminary hearing with respect to this interim relief was held before Sweeney J on 16 May 2024. On21 May 2024,her Honour made orders in the terms sought,appointing two experts,and extended thedefendant’s status as a forensic patient for a period ofthreemonths from the expiry of his limiting term,which was on 27 May 2024:Attorney General for New South Wales v MM (Preliminary)[2024] NSWSC599.That extension is therefore due to expire on27 August 2024.The relevant provisionsForensic patients are dealt with underPt 5 of the Act. The objects ofPt 5 of the Act are set out in s 69(1)as follows:69Objects(1)The objects of this Part are as follows—(a)to protect the safety of members of the public,(b)to provide for the care, treatment and control of persons subject to criminal proceedings who have a mental health impairment or cognitive impairment,(c)to facilitate the care, treatment and control of any of those persons in correctional centres or detention centres through community treatment orders,(d)to facilitate the provision of hospital care or care in the community through community treatment orders for any of those persons who require involuntary treatment,(e)to give an opportunity for those persons to have access to appropriate care,(f)to protect the safety of victims of forensic patients and acknowledge the harm done to victims.In general terms,Pt 5 provides for the review of forensic patients by the Tribunal and gives the Tribunal powers to make orders with respect to the patient's detention and release:s 81. Release may be either unconditional or subject to conditions. The conditions that can be imposed on a forensic patient are set out in s 85 of the Act.Part 6 of the Actdeals with theextension of a person's status as a forensic patient.Section 69(2) provides that the objects set out in s69(1) extend toPt6 of the Act.Section 123 gives standing to the plaintiff to apply for an extension order while s 121 gives the Court power to make an order. The circumstances in which an application can be made and requirements for the application are set out in ss 124 and 125 respectively and are met in the present case. The test for making the order is set out in s 122(1) which provides:122 Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made(1)A forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Part if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that—(a)the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if the patient ceases to be a forensic patient, and(b)the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means.The Court is not required to determine that“the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others”:s 122(2).Furthermore,the Court must have regard to the matters set out in s 127(2) in addition to any other matters it considers relevant. Section 127(2) provides:127Determination of application for extension orders…(2)In determining whether or not to make an extension order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant—(a)the safety of the community,(b)the reports received from the persons appointed under section 126(5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,(c)the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under section 125(b),(d)any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,(e)any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,(f)any report of the Secretary of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Secretary of the Department of Communities and Justice or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,(g)the level of the forensic patient’s compliance with any obligations to which the patient is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on leave of absence granted under this Act),(h)the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,(i)any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.The hearingAt the hearing the plaintiffreliedupona largevolumeof material contained inthe affidavits ofMsJennifer Tsui dated 23 February 2024 and 12 April 2024 and the affidavit ofMsStephanie Breen dated 22 July 2024,together with associated annexures and exhibits.That material replicated the evidence before Sweeney J, with additional evidence post-dating the preliminary hearing. The additional evidence included the reports of the two experts appointed pursuant to the orders of Sweeney J. Both experts were cross-examined on behalf of thedefendant.Thedefendantrelied on affidavits ofMrCallum Hairdated15 May 2024 andMsJessica Smithdated31 July 2024.The background to the application, relevant assessments of thedefendantup until the preliminary hearing were summarised by Sweeney J at[8]–[40]. Her Honour’s reasons should be read together with these reasons.The further evidence available at the final hearing before me is discussed below.Further evidence: Dr CarollyneYoussefDr Carollyne Youssef, a forensic psychologist, was appointed pursuant to the orders made by Sweeney J. Dr Youssefinterviewed the defendant for approximately two and half hours byAVL. She was provided with the documentary material then in existence and relied upon on this application.In her reportshe setout the defendant’s background,developmentalhistoryand his historyof criminal offending.DrYoussefreported that the defendanthadreflected on his past alcohol use, blaming his prior partners on the basis they would often drink together or that he would drink“as he was stressed about their drug use or otherstressorsrelated to them”.He told her he did not need a relapse prevention plan,stating“[it’s]not going to happen…not going to go back…no one can stop it but myself”.He said that he was not currently engaged in any services, but was waiting for an appointment with a psychologist through the TamworthAboriginalMedicalService (“TAMS”).(He had by the time of hearing had one session.)He toldDrYoussefthathedid not need to engage with any other providers or programs, the change that he had made having been his“own hard work”.DrYoussefnoted that the defendant had been released to live with his mother but that there had been difficulties in residing there, in part due to the attitude of family members towards him based on his commitment to abstinence.I interpolate here that the defendant appears to have demonstrated insight into the risk the environment posed for him,the result of which was the arranging oftemporary accommodation in a motel while waiting for his own public housing accommodation. In the event,the defendant moved into his own residence a matter of days before the hearing.(According toother evidencehe was anticipated to move into his accommodation on 1 August 2024.)He told DrYoussefhis primary goal was to reconnect with his children. He had reconnected with some of them and was assisting them with abstaining from drug use.With respect to the application,he expressed his discontentto Dr Youssef, stating that he is“not afuckinforensic patient”andthathe“didn’t do anything wrong”. I pause to note at this point,that this is somewhat different towhat he told DrSathishDayalan,whose psychiatric report dated 4 August 2023 was relied upon by the plaintiff. The defendant told Dr Dayalan,“I was intoxicated…I drank a lot of grog…I wasn’t thinking right…I never want to go through something like this again”;“I don’t do stuff like that.I don’t know what came over me”and“Iama better man than that”.There was, additionally,evidence at the trial that neighbours heard the defendantsay,“I’ve done something horrible”and“kill me”.DrYoussef reportedon the defendant’s time in custody. She noted he was made a special management area placement (SMAP) inmate, separating him from the mainstream prison population on the basis of his vulnerability.She noted he did not incur any institutional offences while in custody, but was moved from his unit for a short time due to concerns he was standing over and bullying other inmates. A behaviour support plan was commenced due to the defendant’s conduct which was said to demonstrate“deficits in interpersonal skills, communication,[problemsolving]and emotional regulation”.DrYoussefnoted that while in custody the defendant had completed several programs includingtheEQUIPSFoundation, which is a general therapeutic program designed to target risk factors related to offending, conducted over 40 hours.I note he also undertook 14 sessions with a psychologist.MMreportedto Dr Youssefthat hehadcompleted a couple of drug courses and that he had learnt to use his breathing when stressed stating that“now when I’m stressed, I justdo tactic breathing”.He was adamant that he did not need to plan for any possibility of relapse in the future.With respect to the assessment of risk,DrYoussefbegan by noting the limitations of risk assessmentstatingthat it is not possible to accurately predict whether an offender will or will not reoffend.She also noted the fact thatrisk assessmentsassess risk generally anddonotevaluatethe likelihood of the commission of an offence resulting in serious harm.DrYoussefset out the results of the various risk assessment tools applied. This included theStatic-99Rwhichplaced the defendant in the average risk category, relative to other male sexual offenders.DrYoussefnoted that in“routine samples with the same score, the5-year sexual recidivism rate is between 2.7 and 3.7 percent”.DrYoussefcautioned that theStatic-99R does notmeasure all relevant risk factors with the result that the defendant’s risk could be higher or lower, and further noted that the test does not discriminate in terms of the potential severity of any reoffending. In order to obtain greater insight into the risk DrYoussefset out her assessment of thevariousrisk and protective factors applied in accordance with other testing protocols.DrYousseffound that the defendant“does pose a risk of harm to others, which has the potential to be serious, if he ceases to be a forensic patient, and is not subject to any other type of protective order”.Significant in this assessment is the defendant’scognitivedeficit andahistory which highlights“a proclivity for poor coping, intimacy deficits, poor general self-regulation, negative attribution bias, attachment deficits, and substance use”.DrYoussefendorsed the view that should alcoholuse resume“it is highly likely that consumption will rapidly escalate andthatsevere problems will once again develop”.DrYoussefexpressed the opinion that continuation of thedefendant’s status as aforensic patient would mitigate some of the risks identified.Also significant in this assessmentis DrYoussef’sopinion that the defendant’s“most robust protective factors stem from external regulations”and that contributing to his present stabilityisthe support he receives from the CSP team and the NationalDisabilityInsurance Scheme (“NDIS”).In cross-examination,DrYoussefgave evidence that alcohol has been a major contributor to the defendant’s prior offending.She noted that, while there were other factors, alcohol was“by far…the significant one”. She accepted that the index offence would not have occurred but for the defendant’s high level of intoxication.DrYoussefagreed that in coming to her conclusions as to the risk of serious harm, the commission of prior offences involving the use of a knife and choking was significant. Absent those features the defendant’s risk would drop to moderate on theparticularrisk assessment toolemployed(the SARA-V3risk assessment tool). I note there can be no criticism of DrYoussefin her relying on a history provided to her which included offences involving a knife and choking.However,on this application the plaintiffultimately accepted that, on review of the facts with respect to that event, the inference to be drawn was that the defendant was not sentenced on the basis that the event involved the use of a knife, but ratherthe facts on which he was sentencedsimply alluded to him picking somethingupin conjunction with him uttering a threat.DrYoussef, in re-examination, clarifieddefendant’suse of any object that could be used as a weapon would be sufficient for her to maintain her opinion.With respect to the allegation of choking, thepolice facts beforeme in relation to this incidentreveal an allegation,including a choking.It was pointed out on behalf of theplaintiffthattheconviction of the defendant was afterahearing, resulting in uncertainty as towhat particular facts were proved in establishing the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.The only allegation of actual bodily harm contained in the facts was bruising to the neck which was said to be the result of the defendant grabbing the complainant in that area.While there is a degree of uncertainty, it is highly likely in those circumstancesthatconviction for actual bodily harm was based on a grabbing of the neck.DrYoussefaccepted that the defendant’s risk of committing a sexual offence was lower than his risk of committing an interpersonal violence offence.She also accepted any risk,presented by the defendant,was lower should he abstain from alcohol andhave stable accommodation. She accepted that, withthedefendanthaving moved into his own accommodation,receivingsupport withrespect today-to-day living and with engagementinpsychological treatment and occupational therapy, his risk was reduced. She, however, raised a concern that thedefendantcontinue to engage with these supports noting that thedefendantcould not be compelled to utilise such services provided through the NDIS.Further evidence: Ms LisaZipparoMs Lisa Zipparo is aclinical neuropsychologist, appointed pursuant to the orders made by Sweeney J.Ms Zipparoprovideda detailed report dated11 July 2024.She saw thedefendantforapproximatelytwo hours.Inherreport she set out thedefendant’s history and summarised the content of the various reports andotherdocumentary material she had received. She set out the results of her neuropsychological assessment, in which she found, in summary, that thedefendanthas“severe impairments in most areas of cognitive functioning”, with his results across various domains in either the borderline or, more predominantly, the severely impaired range.Ms Zipparoapplied the Static-99Rrisk assessment tool which, consistent with the Dr Youssef’s results,indicated an“average”risk of sexual re-offending. Like Dr Youssef,shesaidthisis“generally equivalent to theaverage rate of sexual reoffending in the overall population of individuals convicted of sexually motivated offences”.Ms Zipparowent on to observe that about half the individuals within the average risk category will transition to a below-average risk“within a year or two after appropriate support and treatment”.Ms Zipparoalso applied a structured professional judgment risk assessment tool called theARMIDILO-Swhich is designed specifically for use with individuals with intellectual impairments who have either offended sexually or displayed sexually offensive behaviour.Ms Zipparoset out her assessment of the various risk factors and protective factors in accordance with that tool.Based on her assessment,Ms Zipparoassessed the defendant as having a“moderate to high risk of any reoffending and a moderate risk of sexual reoffending if he ceases to be a forensic patient”.Ms Zipparorecommended continuation of the defendant’s forensic status in order to managehisrisk of causing serious harm to others. This was on the basis ofherconclusions as to the defendant’s absence of insight into his cognitive impairments and need for treatment,together with a long history of treatment non-compliance suggesting a need for mandated treatment to address the defendant’s past trauma and drug and alcoholissues.Incross-examinationMs Zipparoexplained theaetiology of the defendant’s cognitive impairment,explaining that its nature was such that she would not expect an improvement in his cognitive functions“in any substantial way”. She also agreed thatalcoholwas the biggest risk factor, but that frontal lobe damage on its ownleads to“impulsivity,inhibition, poor insight, poor decision-making”which were things which needed to be managed because“they are not going to [go] away”.Ms Zipparogave evidence that, as a result ofthe defendant’sdeficits, strategies and routines would take longer than normal to learn and implement, leading to her recommendation to extendhisstatus as a forensic patient. Positively, she observed that he had been working hard to implement what he had learnt including strategies for managing his anxiety. She said that he had demonstrated the capacity to learn and change but that“he is going to need longer than normal”to make what he has learnt part of his normal routine.In that vein,Ms Zipparoindicated that she would like to see established relationshipswithadrug and alcohol counsellor and atherapist dealing withpast trauma.Ms Zipparogave evidence that the defendant required more than the 10 hours a week support presently allocated to himunder the NDIS. Her evidence was,however, that even with these supports in place she remained concerned as tohis risk in the absence of established relationships withcounsellorsof the kindreferred to immediately above.The defendant’s treatment under the current orderThe most recent MHRT decision is that of 9 February 2024, conducted pursuant to the obligation to review patients at intervals of six months: s78(d) of the Act. The previous conditions were maintained, subject to some relatively minor changes. The effect of the conditions is to put in place a case manager with whom thedefendantis to have contact weekly, with a face-to-face meeting at least once a month.There are conditions in relation to where he may live, essentially requiring the case manager to approve his accommodation. The conditions prohibit the use of alcohol and drugs and provide for random testing to detect the use of alcohol. Of significance on the application are the following conditions:“6. [MM] is to participate in any psychological treatment, education, training, rehabilitation, recreational, therapeutic or other programs which his case manager asks him to attend.7.In particular [MM] is to attend the Tamworth Aboriginal Medical Service as directed by his case managerand participate in such programs offered bythe Service, including its Drug and Alcohol program, as recommended by his case manager. [MM] is also to attend the Centrecare Men’s Behavioural Change program as directed by his case manager.”There is no evidence that any counselling has been put in placebeyond one session with a psychologist arranged through TAMS. This is despite the plaintiff’s application being based on the need for such treatment. This issue is discussed further below.In its reasons for its 9 February 2024 orders, the MHRT referred to the evidence before the Tribunal and observed:“Overall, the CSP considers that he has demonstrated self-directed compliance with the conditions of his order, engagement with supports and services and has started making progress towards establishing positive lifestyle. He has also been accepted into the Tamworth Aboriginal Medical Service to access the alcohol, tobacco and other drugs support service. He has also been accepted into the men’s behavioural change program and attended the first session on 22 January 2024. The program supports men who used abusive and controllingbehaviour towards their partners or family members to change their behaviour. He has also started work on a casual basis mowing lawns and undertaking general garden maintenance and would like to start his own business.”It was noted that on thedefendant’s release from prison in Novemberthatmany of the courses were in holiday shutdown but were expected to restart.That does not,of course,explain the lack of progress to date.Further evidence was obtained by the plaintiff in preparation for the hearing, including records relating to the administration of the conditions attaching to the defendant’s status as a forensic patient.Those records showed the defendant had been tested for alcohol consumption with no use detected.It should be noted that quite apart from the negative testing,no suggestion was made that the defendant has at any stage since his release,relapsed into alcohol use and Ifind positively that he has not.A case note dated 19 June 2024 indicatesthe defendanthad been accessing support workers three days a week. It would appear this is a reference to support provided through the NDIS. The note indicates a psychologist or counsellor was being sought to assist the defendant with his then“tumultuoushousing situation”, reference being made to the consumption of alcohol and cannabis at that location. The inference to be drawn is that no psychological counselling was then in place. The note indicates the defendant was attending theTAMSAlcohol, Tobaccoand Other Drugs Services“as needed”. Is unclear as to what,in practical terms, thismeans.Records of phone conversations between the defendant (at times with his NDIS support worker) and the CSP teamwere tendered. Those notes are demonstrative of the defendant’s resolve to remain crime free. They include references to an altercation with a nephewto which the defendant responded by attending policeto obtainanapprehended violenceorder. There is also a report of an altercation between the defendant and his son in the context of the defendant attempting to assist his sontocease hisuse ofcrystalmethylamphetamine(“ice”). It was reported the defendant, on this occasion,used breathing techniques to calm himself and“did not even think about havinga drink”. The note also reportedthe defendant’s concernswith respect to,and desire to dissociate himself from,the home environment as a result of the use of drugs and alcoholon the premises.The notesalsomake reference to the support being provided through the NDIS,a matterwhich is discussed below.The defendant’s evidence - his NDIS planThe defendant relied on an affidavitofMs Jessica Smith, the coordinator of supports atLittle Blue Wren, the defendant’s NDIS provider.(The NDIS plan was also annexed to an affidavit of the defendant’s solicitor.)She deposed that she has contact with the defendant on an“as needs”basis, currently seeing the defendant approximately two or three times a week.The defendant has a weekly schedule pursuant to which support workers are available to him on Mondays,Wednesdays and Thursdays between 9amand 1pm, with some variability depending on the defendant’s needs. The support offered provides access to the community, assistance with attending appointments, compliance with legal obligations and securing and maintaining housing.With regard to the latter,Ms Smithdeposedthat the defendant had been allocated a two-bedroom public housing unit in Tamworth, and was to move into that property on1August. It was confirmed at the hearing that he had,in fact,moved into the premises.Ms Smith indicated that the defendant’s deficits resulted in difficulties with planning,decision-making and goal setting.In her opinion,he requires support in relation to anger management, financial management, medical management and in maintaining his tenancy. On this basis she has submitted a request for additionalNDISfunding for the defendant for“home and living”.Her aim is for the defendant to receive more comprehensiveassistancein relation to his self-care and to ensure that his social and therapeutic needsaremore effectively met.Based on her experience,she anticipates that the defendant will receive an increase in funding but said she did not know if it would extend to“home andliving”funding.She also indicated it was proposed to make a guardianship application.Ms Smith noted that the defendant had attended his first appointment with a psychologist from TAMS on 22 July 2024, having been on the waitlist for about eight weeks.ConsiderationWithout wishing to oversimplify matters,thequestion as to therisk posed by the defendant appears to me to come down to the risk that he will relapse into alcohol abuse. While there was evidence that interpersonal difficulties continued while the defendant was in custody and not consuming alcohol, the risk that the defendant will have difficulties of that nature while not affected by alcohol, does not, having regard to his history more generally, rise to the pointwhere it could be assessed asgiving rise toan unacceptablerisk of serious harm.The risk of thedefendantcommitting a personal violence offence is, essentially,the product of the risk of him becoming intoxicated, him committing a personal violence offence and that personal violence offence causing serious harm.In the event that thedefendantdoes become intoxicated,the risk of him committing a personal violence offence is very high. The risk of serious harm from such an event is more difficult to predict. Without wishing to trivialise the various acts of violence committed by the defendant, the consequences of those acts have not risen above actual bodily harm. That is not to say that something more than actual bodily harm is required to establish“serious harm”:seeAttorneyGeneral of New South Walesv Kereopa (No 2)[2017]NSWSC928.The nature of any injury sustained as a result of an assault will often involve, at least to an extent, a degree of happenstance. That is, for the purposes of looking forward, the consequences of some of the defendant’s past acts of violence could have been significantly more grave.Of course, this remains a very different level of risk when compared with a person with a history of intentionally inflicting grave harm. The risk of the defendantcausing seriousharmas a result of a personal violence offenceis significantly attenuated by comparison.The risk of the defendant committing a sexual offence absent intoxication seems to meto bevery low, probably negligible.Even intoxicated, the index offence appears to have been a“one-off”.Acknowledging that to be the case,the facts of the offending suggest that, in the event the defendant should again become intoxicated to the extent that he was, there is a prospect ofhimengaging in serious criminal conduct that would otherwise not have been expected.As I have said, central to the defendant’s risk is the risk he will return to the consumption of alcohol. The defendant in this regard has made,impressive progress. Whether it be as a result ofthe defendant’s incarceration for what was by far the longest period he has experienced(his longest previous incarceration beingfor two months in 2000), the commission of an offence which the evidence suggests he may have difficulty reconciling with his own sense of self; the realisation that alcohol has caused and will continue to cause harm to himself and others;ora combination of these orother reasons, it is plain that the defendant has made a strong commitment to abstinence.His choice to move away from family who did not understand his choice, his attempts to assist two of his sons with their addictions,and his response to his conditional liberty more generally, all suggest he has redefined himself as a man who does not use alcohol or drugs.It is, as I remarked at the hearing,impressiveprogress.Suggestions that the defendant“lacks insight”must, in my view, be temperedbythe knowledge that the steps he has taken clearly demonstrate a keen awareness of the dangers of alcohol for him, and those around him. That said, the lack of insight referred to was primarily a reference to a concern that the defendant underestimates the risk of relapse, andthepotential benefit of supports that may prevent this.Theriskof relapsemust be understood in the context of the evidencethat the defendant consumed alcohol every day from a young age until his incarceration in 2020at the age of51(presumably excluding time he had previously been in custody).While the defendant has not consumed alcohol for a period in excess of four years, other than for the last nine monthsof that timehe has been in custody.While nine months is not an insignificant period of abstinence in the community,in context it is a relatively short period giventhe defendant’s long history of alcohol misuse.Theplaintiff’s submission that it is still“early days”has some force.The risk of relapse is significant in the case of anyone suffering a long standing addiction.The defendant’s position is further complicated by the impact of his cognitive impairment.The evidence in this regardfrom Dr Youssef was that:“[MM’s]neurocognitive impairment indirectly impacts on his risk by affecting other dynamic risk factors, such as his poorcoping, impulsivity, compromised executive dysfunction and self-awareness.”And further:“Whilst there is no evidence that alcohol-induced[neurocognitive deficit]is directly related to risk of sexual or violent offending behaviour, the condition can cause various deficits that together can create a situation where[MM]may be less able to control his impulses, regulate emotions, and make sound decisions, thereby increasing the likelihood of engaging in offending behaviour.”A similar view was expressed byMs Zipparo.While significant progress has been made it must be borne in mind that he has had only one session with a psychologist.Proposed occupational therapy has not yet commenced.There does not appear to be regular drug and alcohol counselling in place.It is highly regrettable that this application should be made by the plaintiff, in large measure on the basis of these needs, in circumstances wherethesupports said to be required have not been put in place over the nine months thedefendanthas been in the community.There issomeforce in thedefendant’ssubmission thatextensionof theorder tomitigateriskis not warranted asno inference can be drawnthatthe making of an orderwill result in the provision of therapy for past trauma and drug and alcohol counselling.Against this, however, is the fact that, perhaps somewhat belatedly, psychological counselling has commenced. While there are concerns that it may not be sufficiently specialised, it is a start. While drug and alcohol and psychological support might be thought to be obvious interventions in a case such as this,andperhaps shouldhave been commenced earlier, I would expect that the opinions of the court appointed experts and these reasons will have the effect ofcausingthese measuresto be putin place within a relatively short time.Further,it isnoteworthythat itisconsidered that greater support should be provided to the defendantunder the NDISandthat, while thisfundinghas been applied for,it had notyet, at the time of the hearing,been approved.There islimitedevidence before me as totheextent ofanyadditional services that might be provided,with the result that I can only proceedon the basis ofthe level of support the defendant presently receives, and the opinion of those providing that supportwhich isthat greater support is required.Significantly, thedefendanthad moved into his accommodation only a matter of days before the hearing. While this is a positivestep, he is yet to establish any routines. It is to be recalled that thedefendant’sonlyexperience of living in the community,andnot abusing alcohol, is the nine monthsthat have elapsedsince his release. He has, in that time,not beenin a domestic relationship, a circumstance he identified as, in the past, placing him under stress and leading to the consumption of alcohol. He has a dearth of pro-social relationships, these essentially being provided by NDIS support workers and his supervision under the CSP.The matter is somewhat finely balanced. Thedefendanthas, as I have been at pains to point out, made great strides. What makes his progress so significant is, of course, his history. The length of that history which encompasses essentially a lifetime of alcohol abuse remains highly relevant. Having regard to that history, his particular deficits and the considerations setout in s127(2)discussed above and in the reasons of Sweeney J, I am of the view that thedefendantposes an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases to be a forensic patient.While there are other supports available to thedefendant, particularly through the NDIS and a proposed application for a guardianship order, I accept the views of bothDrYoussef andMs Zipparothat an extended order is the least restrictive means available to adequately manage thedefendant’s risk. While thedefendantis currently positively engaged with the NDIS, that is in the context of his abstinence. In the event that that abstinence is threatened, thedefendant’s past response to supervision and support suggest thatmandated intervention is likely to be necessary.The plaintiff sought an order for 18 months. At the hearing it became apparent that theprimaryutility of the order is to enable the establishment of therapeutic relationships and stability in the community. It is not clear why 18 months should be necessary to establish these relationships. Further, the recent resolution of thedefendant’s housing situation suggests a shorterperiod of time will be sufficient to ensure thedefendantpositively habituated in his new setting. I regard 12 months as a sufficient period for the extension of the order.OrdersI make the following orders:Pursuant to ss 121of theMental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act 2020(NSW), the defendant’sstatus as a forensic patientis extendedfor a period of12 months from today,16August 2024.Access to the reports of the two court appointed experts is to be provided to thedefendant’s treatingteam.Access to theSupremeCourt’sfilein respect of any document shall not be granted to a non-party withoutleave of a Judge of the Court and ifany application for access is made by a non-party in respect of any document,the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to allowtheman opportunity to be heard inrelation to theapplication foraccess.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

That misstated the exchangewhich was as follows:[17]", "footnotes": ["[17]"]}, {"p_num": 58, "text": "If the Court were to infer that the plaintiff was making an application to reopen the order made (and entered) yesterday to refuse the application to vacate the hearing, that application should be refused. Not onlytherea misapprehension as to what was said in Court (and I appreciate that the plaintiffdidnot have the transcript and may not have understood what was said at the time)but it is now clear that the proceeding was bound to fail."}, {"p_num": 59, "text": "For these reasons the Court makes the following orders:"}], "full_text": "JUDGMENTBASTEN AJ:On 11 August 2022,the defendant Inner West Council (Council), through itsauthorised officer,made a declaration that a dog owned by the plaintiff, Tertia Harry,was a“menacing dog”within s 33A(1)of theCompanion AnimalsAct1998(NSW). The plaintiff seeks judicial review of the declaration.The declarationfollowed an investigation ofa complaint by a resident of Rozellewhohad encountered the plaintiff and her dog, known as“Rockstar”,whilstwalkinghis dog“Maisy”one evening on Darling Street, Rozelle(Rozelle incident).He told a Council officer that theplaintiff’s doghad acted aggressively towards his dog (which he had picked up), but the plaintiff’s dog, had jumped up and bitten his dog on the leg.A menacing dog declaration has a number of statutory consequences, includingthat(i) the dog must be desexed; (ii) whilstat home, it must be enclosed in a manner sufficient to restrain the dog and prevent a child from having access to it; (iii) whilst outsideits home, it must be“under the effective control of some competent person”and must be“muzzled in a manner that is sufficient to prevent it from biting any person or animal”, and (iv) it cannot be under the control of a person who has more than one other dog under his or her control at the one time.[1]The plaintiff had, in the course of the investigation, expressed concern at the possibility that she might be required to desex the dog, on the basis that such a step might have adverse consequencesforthe health of the animal.Shealso claimed thatconsequence(iv),allowinghertowalk Rockstarwithno more thanone otherdogprevented her running herdog walkingbusiness,therewas no constraint on herwalkingseveralother dogs without her own dog.Jurisdiction of CourtAlthough there is a right of appeal to the Local Court from a declaration by an authorised officer that a dog is a“dangerous”dog, there is no such right ofappeal with respect to a menacing dog declaration.[2](It is not entirely clearfrom the Actthat theconsequences of a dangerous dogdeclarationare significantly more severe than those applicable to a menacing dog: see s51(1); but see also Companion Animals Regulation 2018 (NSW) (Regulation), Pt 6.)In the absence of a right of appeal, the only relief available with respect to the declaration was to proceed by way of judicial review in the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 69 of theSupreme Court Act 1970(NSW). Such a challenge is required to be lodged within three months of the date of theimpugned decision.[3]With respectto the declaration made on 11 August 2022, time expired on 10 November 2022. The summons seeking judicial review was not in fact filed until 8September2023, some ten months out of time. The plaintiff has not formally sought an extension of time, nor provided anyclearexplanation as to the cause of the delay. The extension was opposed by the Council, but primarily on the basis that the application lacked merit. As there is no stay on the effect of thedeclaration(which has now been in force for two years) the appropriate course is to consider the merits and if warranted grant an extension of time. The Councilacceptedthatnoprejudice flowedfrom such a course.The Court’sjudicial reviewjurisdiction is limited to ensuring that the Council did not exceed its statutory powers and functions in making the menacing dog declaration. Errorsof that kindarebroadly characterised as“jurisdictional error”, although administrative officers are generally understood to exercise powers or functions rather than“jurisdiction”.Not all legal errors are categorised as“jurisdictional”,although the circumstances in which a statutory scheme permits an administrative officer to make unreviewable errors of law in exercising an administrative function are quite limited. (There was no privative provision protecting the Council in this case.)Apart from jurisdictional error, theotherbasis of judicial review is described as“error of law on the face of the record”. Under the general law, the record was confined to the documentsengaging the powers of the decision-maker,and the final determination or orders of thatperson or body. That understanding of the record was broadenedin 1996 when theSupreme Court Actwas amended to includes 69(4),whichstates that“the face of the record includes the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal for its ultimate determination”.At a time when it was understood that judicial review (in the form of prerogative writs) was confined to bodies exercising a judicial function, reference to the record of a“court or tribunal”was appropriate and clear in its scope. Once the scope of judicial review extended to all administrative decision-making, the nature of the record became more obscure.Thus, it is unclear whether s 69(4) extends to an administrative decision-maker whowould notordinarily be described as a“court or tribunal”.Indeed,s 69(4)may well not have been intended to extend to administrative decision-makers who, absent statutory provisions requiring otherwise, are not subject to a general law requirement to give reasons.[4]Section 69(4) was inserted in theSupreme Court Actin 1996.It is not necessary to pursuethe scope of s 69(4)further: the Council was content to deal with theclaimon the basis that the plaintiff could treatthe authorised officer’sreasons for her determination as part of the record for the purpose of identifying error of law on the face of the record.It is also unnecessary to pursue it because the errors apparently raised by the plaintiff are properly characterised as jurisdictional errors.Once it is submitted, for example,thatthe defendanttook into account“irrelevant considerations”, the reasons become part of the evidence to establish the factual basis of a jurisdictional challenge andarerelevant and admissible for that purpose.BackgroundBefore identifying the groundsof review, it is convenient to note the steps taken by the Council following receipt of a complaint from the owner of the dog allegedly attacked. TheRozelleincidenttook place on Saturday, 8 January2022 shortly after 7:30pm; the owner ofthe victimmade a complaint to the Council’s Companion AnimalTeam on Monday, 10 January 2022. An investigation was carried out,in the course ofwhich the plaintiff was given an opportunity to be interviewed and provide her own account of the incident.She declined to do so.On 11 July 2022, Ms Caroline Hamilton, a companion animal officer with the Council, completed an“Investigation Determination”. It identified the alleged attacking dog“Rockstar”as a South AfricanBoerboel,andthe alleged victim dog“Maisy”as a French Bulldog. The first two pages of the report set out the allegations made by the owner of Maisy; the third page wasa list of attachments, including witness statements, photographs, certificates of registration for both dogs,anda printout from the Companion Animals Register maintained under Pt 9 of theCompanion Animals Actof a“dog attackincident”(though which incident, or both, was unclear from the list of attachments).TheInvestigation Determinationthen set out(at pp 4-6)facts as to which the Council was satisfied on the evidence before it,in 17 bullet point entries.Of these,13 related to the Rozelle incident, although reference was made to a prior complaint in identifying the dogas Rockstar.Theother four findings involvedapriorincident involvingthe plaintiff as a person in charge of a dog(“Joey”)thathadattacked, andtwopriorattacks recorded with respect to Rockstar,one ofwhichwasdismissed as“insufficiently established”on the evidence.The findings resulted in a further set of considerations under the heading“Determination”which commenced with the following statement:“An assessment of the evidence currently identifies that the following potential breaches of the[Act]… may have occurred on the time and date specified:”Three findings were made in that section, namelythat:the plaintiffhadfailed to notify a change to the registration information forhertwo dogs, contrary to s 11(1) of theAct;the plaintiff hadnotfailed to keep Rockstar“under effective control”at the time of the incident, thus rejecting apossible breach of s13 of the Act, andRockstar had rushed at and attacked Maisy without provocation on Saturday 8 January 2022, being a breach of s 16 of the Act.The evidence for each of those findings was identified.Under theheading“Regulatory action”,it was noted that the Council should:issue twopenaltyinfringement notices with respect to breaches of s11;issueacourt attendance notice under s 16, for the purpose of seeking a control order from theLocal Court pursuant to s 47 of the Act, andpreparea notice of intention to declareRockstarto be a menacing dog.The last itemmay beimplied from the inclusion of such a notice.The noticeof intentionadvised:(i)what should be done“immediately”with respect to the dog(pursuant to s 36of the Act); (ii) thepenaltiesfor failure to complywiththe statutory conditions;and(iii) the right to object to the proposed declaration (pursuant to s 35),by making representations totheCouncil“within7daysofthe date this notice was given to you”,and (iv)theeffectof the declaration,if made. An email address for representations was provided.The notice of intention, in the form of a letter, was dated 11 July 2022, but according to the plaintiff wasreceivedon 16 July 2022. She responded on 22 July 2022, objecting to the proposed declaration and providing an account of the Rozelle incident which cast Maisy as the aggressor.She also denied that Rockstar had bitten Maisy, or indeed, any dog, ever.There wereseveralfurtheremail communicationsbetweenher andMs Nelson, the officer of the Council authorised to determine whether to makethemenacing dog declaration.On 28 July 2022, the plaintiff sent a final written submission, with attachments, resisting the making of the declaration(28 Julysubmission).She did not repeat her account of the Rozelle incident, but, noting the factual dispute as to what occurred, submitted that the Council could not proceed on allegations in the absence of“official legitimate proof”.Theplaintiffprovided evidencethaton 26 November 2021 Rockstarhad received an implant ofSuprelorin, apparently effective for six months,being a testosterone suppressant. She also included a report prepared on 21 June 2020 by Dr Melissa Starling,entitled“AssistanceDogSuitabilityAssessment”, together with asecondreport of Dr Starling dated 21 June 2022, entitled“Menacing/Dangerous Dog Assessment”.On 10 August 2022, Ms Nelson determined that a menacing dog declaration should be issued by the Council and that the Director General of the Office of Local Government and the plaintiff be advised of this decision within seven days. In fact,Ms Nelson advised the plaintiff of the determination that day. The declaration was signed by the authorised officer, Ms Hamilton, and dated 11 August 2022.In her determination, Ms Nelson addressed all the substantive issues raised by the plaintiff in her last28 Julysubmission.Grounds of reviewAlthough the plaintiff first filed a summons seeking judicial review on 8 September 2023, it was quickly supersededby a second summons filed on 18 October 2023. Both were largely incoherent. After the plaintiff had obtained pro bono advice, she filedan amended summons on 27 March 2024.The part of the amended summons identifying the decisionunder reviewreferred to the declaration of 11 August 2022 as“the decision made by Ms Hamilton as an authorised officer”ofthe Council. Although it is true that Ms Hamilton signed the declaration, as explained above the decision to make the declaration was that of Ms Nelson. The report of Ms Hamilton, as the investigating officer, was a part of the process of decision-making, but the findings she made did notconstitute an“ultimate determination”,[5]that is a determination affecting a person’s rights or interests.[6]It was therefore not reviewable.Even had it been reviewable, it was superseded by the decision made by Ms Nelson which waseffectedbyMs Hamilton signing the declaration. So far as procedural fairness was concerned, the plaintiff had ample opportunity to respond to the factual findings by Ms Hamilton. She does not submit otherwise. Accordingly, to the extent that the amended summons misconceived the nature of the decision, itcould be dismissed on that basis.Nevertheless, the Council addressed the substance of thegroundsand it is therefore appropriate for theCourt to do the same.The first ground, referred to as“a”,stated that the authorised officer (Ms Hamilton)took into accountirrelevant considerations,“as recorded in a document headed‘InvestigationDetermination’”dated 7 March 2022. Three such matters(particulars)were identified:(i)the plaintiff’s prior history, in relation to an incident at Henson Park, Marrickville,that did not involve the dog namedRockstarbut a dog named Joey;(ii)Rockstar’s “prior history of attack” including as recorded on the NSW Companion Animals Register an alleged incident at Leichardt Street, Glebe,on 13October 2019 in circumstances where there has been “no formal finding of an attack by Rockstar”;and(iii)incorrect records on the Companion Animals Register relating to the Glebeincident, namely that “Rockstar has a prior history of attacking a person… on 13/10/2019 causing a minor injury”. The record was said to be false.The second ground, identified as“b”, alleged that Ms Hamilton based her decision“in part, upon the incorrect records for Rockstar in the companionanimals register relating to the Glebe incident”. The ground continued, discursively:“Under Ms Jenny Nelson’s instructions…, [the plaintiff] submitted a ‘full re submission of her representation contesting theNoticeOfIntention toDeclare aDog to be a menacingDog against the dog Rockstar’ at 2.36pm on 29 July 2022, just 1.5 hours before Ms Jenny Nelson’s cutoff time for Ms Harry’s final re submission. That email and all ofit’s[sic] attachments are found in the additional affidavit. The material submitted proved that the CAR records on Rockstar were false, yet Ms Hamilton still proceeded with theMenacingDogOrder on 11/8/22.”In its written submissions in response, the Council treated this as an assertion that the decision was legally unreasonable and thus engaging a form of jurisdictional error.As it relates to the consideration of the Glebe incident, it may be addressed in dealing with particulars (ii) and (iii), which also related to the Glebe incident in 2019. There were in effect only two incidents the subject of the grounds of review: no challenge was directed to the operative findings as to the Rozelle incident in January 2022.Before dealing with each of these matters in turn, it is necessary to identify two legal principles.Irrelevant considerationsThe first is that, for the purposes of judicial review,taking into accountan“irrelevant consideration”is to be understood as breaching a statutory prohibition;that is, taking account of a matter which is not permitted to be taken account of in the proper and lawful exercise of the administrative function.[7]Some considerations are prohibited by general laws, including those relating to discrimination on the grounds of race,genderand other factors. That was not always the case. In 1947, a statute conferring discretion on aCommission to grant or refuse consent to the transfer of an irrigation-farm lease was held to permit refusal of consent to an Italian farmer on the grounds of his ethnicorigins.[8]However, generally, therelevantprohibition will be found within the terms of the specific statute conferring authority and, if no particular matter is identified as a prohibited consideration, the prohibition must appear by implication from the subject-matter,scope and purpose of the legislative scheme.[9]Where a person is charged with committing an offence, the criminal lawgenerallyinsists upon the charge being considered on its merits and not by referencetopastmisconduct or misconduct on other occasions. But thatis not always so: if misconduct on other occasions demonstrates a tendency to act in a particular way, there will be circumstances in which the probative value of such evidence exceeds the potentialprejudiceand it is admissible.TheCompanion Animals Actdoes create offences, but not against animals. Furthermore, the present proceedings are not concerned with a criminal offence, but with a regulatory scheme for the control of animals. In principle, prior occasions upon which a dog owner has been unable to control his or her dog,and prior occasions on which theparticulardoghas behaved badly,may reasonably be treated as relevant to whether adeclarationshould be made in relation to the dog, or prosecution initiated against the dog’s owner for an offence, and if so, by what procedure.As the Council submitted, there is nothing in the legislative scheme which requires an authorisedofficer to treat such matters as irrelevant in all circumstances. Indeed, rather the contrary.Theprincipalobject of the Act, set out in s 3A,“is to provide for the effective and responsible care and management ofcompanionanimals”. Theprimaryresponsibilityplaced on owners and persons in charge of dogsisto keep a dog in a public place“under the effective control of some competent person”: s 13. Persons convicted ofcertain offences under the Act may be permanently disqualified from owning a dog orbeing in charge ofa dog in a public place: s 23(1).Importantly, the Act makes provision in Pt9 foraRegister of Companion Animals: s 79.Itprovides for records to be included on theRegister ofeach registered companion animal, and its owner and, relevantly,the“compliance history”of the owner: s 80(2)(d). The“compliance history”includes a record of any conviction of the person for an offence against the Act, or other legislation, the issue of a penalty notice with respect to such an offence, the making ofacontrol order and, pursuant to theRegulation,“dog attack information”.[10]Indeed, the Regulation requires that a council enter information concerning a dog attack, defined to include“an incident that involves oris alleged toinvolve a dog rushing at, attacking, biting, harassing or chasing a person or animal (other thanvermin), whether or not any injury is caused to the person or animal”within 72 hours of receiving such information.[11]No doubt for privacy reasons, access by members of the public to theRegister is limited.[12]However, a local authority may approve any employee or class or its employees to have access to theRegister: s 83C(1).[13]It is, therefore, a significant purpose of the maintenance of theRegister to provide access tocouncil officers authorised for the purposes of theCompanion Animals Act, which will include access to allegations about dog attacks, as well as the prior history of dog owners. The legislative scheme is thus inconsistent with any implied limitation on the use to which authorised officers can put information contained on theRegister in carrying out the statutory functions ofacouncilwith respect to companion animals,including considering making a menacing dog declaration.Exercising an administrative powerThe second principle to be borne in mind is that theauthorisedofficer is notadjudicatingthe commission of an offence, norimposing a punishmentfor criminal conduct. That function is vested in the Local Court in which the rules of evidence and criminal procedure apply.Elements of the offencemust be established beyond reasonable doubt for a finding of guilt.By way of contrast, the authorised officer of alocalcouncil, in considering whether to make a menacing dog declaration, is not subject to any such constraints.If a charge is laid, he or she is not required to await the outcome oftheprosecution fortheoffence,nor bound by the conclusion. As the High Court stated inAustralian Communications and Media Authority v Today FM (Sydney) Pty Ltd,[14]in relation to the regulation of commercial radio broadcasting,“it is not offensiveto principlethat an administrative body is empowered to determine whether a person has engaged in conduct that constitutes a criminal offence as a step in the decision to take disciplinary or other action”.[15]The reasoning continued, by reference to another example:“There is no reason to suppose that a Commonwealth public housing authority might lack the capacity to terminate a lease on the ground of the tenant’s use of the premises for an unlawful purpose not withstanding that the tenant has not been convicted of an offence arising out of that unlawful use.”Further the joint reasons stated at [49]:“Where a person is prosecuted for the relevant offence, the Authority is not bound by the outcome of the criminal proceeding and may come to a contrary view based upon the material and submissions before it.”These principles have direct application to the function of the authorised officer making a declaration under s 33 of theCompanion Animals Act.Application of these principles is sufficient to demonstrate that the ground relating to irrelevant considerations is misconceived. However, it is convenient to address each of the three particulars of ground a and ground b.Consideration of grounds of reviewGroundaalleged the taking into account of irrelevant consideration, identified in three particulars.Henson Park incident– April 2019Particular (i)appears to havebeen directedto the following statement inthe InvestigationDetermination:“The defendant Ms Harryhas a prior history of being in charge of a dog that attacks, recorded on the NSW Companion Animals Register as Dog AttackIncident A19052306 and Inner West Council reference REQ2019-035291, related to an attack on a dog causing injuries that required medical treatment that occurred at Henson Park, Marrickville inApril2019 and for which aPenaltyInfringementNotice was issued under s 16 of the [Act]. The alleged offending dog in this incident was a dog walking/minding client’s animal named ‘Joey’…. A search of Council records and documentation from Council’s legal department indicates that the infringement notice was court-elected by Ms Harry and, following several court appearances, was dismissed by the magistrate based on a successful s 32 Mental Health application.[16]...An allegation concerning the dog ‘Rockstar’ as displaying aggressive behaviour and/or also being involved in the dog attack at Henson Park, Marrickville was evaluated based on the testimonies obtained during that investigation and found to be insufficient.”As noted above, the plaintiff made two substantive responses to theInvestigationDetermination.Neithermadespecificreference to the Henson Park incidentand the dog Joey. It isthereforeunsurprising that no reference was made to this matter by Ms Nelson in her reasons for determining that a declaration should be issued. No issue was taken with Ms Nelson’s conclusion or reasons.Consideration of the prior history with respect to the attack by a dog under the plaintiff’s control was not prohibited.There is no basis to infer that the reliance placed on it was legally improper or that it exceeded the power of the authorised officer.Glebe incident – 13 October 2019It is convenient to deal with particulars(ii) and (iii) together as both relate to an incident which occurred at Leichardt Street, Glebe on 13 October 2019. Indeed, groundbalso dealt with that incidentandwill be addressed below.The Glebe incident was treated by Ms Hamilton as part of Rockstar’s“prior history of attack”.Particular (ii) noted that there had been“no formal finding of an attack by Rockstar”. However, in keeping with the principles stated inACMA v Today FM, there was no basis in theCompanion Animals Act, or any other legal source,for excluding consideration of an incidentbecausethere had been“no formal finding of an attack”, whatever that may mean. It was a matter for the authorised officer to consider on the material before her whether the incident of which complaint had been made in 2019 had occurred. As already noted, if a dog has a prior history of attack, it isnotpossible to conclude that an authorised officeris prohibited fromthat into account in determining whether to make a menacing dog declaration, or take other action, or no action.It was not suggested that the information was used for an improper purpose. It may be inferred from the Investigation Determination that it was primarily relied on to charge an offence (rather than issue a penalty notice), though that was not the limit of the available uses.Particular (iii) allegedthat the attack on 13 October 2019 causing the owner of another dog to suffer a minor injury“was found to be false by evidence heard in Court on 27/3/21”. The rest of theparticular setout, tendentiously, statements of fact as to what was shown by the evidence, some of which itquoted,some of which it didnot.It relied in part on atranscript(possibly prepared by the plaintiff)of a recording of the incident, including the plaintiff’s comments, for example as to which dog growled first. The transcriptwas in a volume of material tendered by the plaintiffin this Court, butit was unclear whether it hadbeen provided to the Council officers prior to the making of the declaration: much of the volume post-dated the declaration and could not have been before the officers. The plaintiff’s affidavitfiled on 8 September 2023,towhich the volume was exhibited (and not properly attested), did not state which (if any)of the exhibiteddocuments were before the officers.It was not amongst the precisely identified documents before Ms Nelson, nor amongst the documents identified by Ms Hamilton as before her.TheInvestigationDetermination referred to the incident,which had been investigated bytheCity of Sydney Council, as an attack“on a person and their dog, causing minor injuries”, for which penalty infringement notices were issued. Theplaintiff tookthematter tothe LocalCourt; the magistratedismissedthe chargepursuant to s 32 of theMental Health (Forensic Provisions) Actandimposed conditions inthe form of apsychological health plan for the plaintiff. Pursuant to s 32(4):(4)A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.Theentry in theRegister for the incident recorded the following:“Summary of Attack from investigating officer: a few moments before the attack there was growling from both dogs. The complainant walked away carrying his dog. The attacking dog then followed and chased them and knocked the complainant over. Because of the force of being knocked over they dropped their owndogand the attacking dog then pinned the other dog. Penalty notice issued. CourtElected; Downing Centre Local Court: no findings made/dismissed.”It is not clear whatevidence(if any)wasput before Ms Hamilton to support a finding that theCompanionAnimalsRegister record was incorrect or false.Nor was the element of falsity identified; it was not obvious. The record contained three statements. The first was a summary of the investigating officer’s report; the second identified the steps taken; the third identified the outcome. There may have been a dispute as to the accuracy of the summary, but the court did not rule upon it.In any event, the accuracy of the document was not relevant to whether it was a document to which the officer was entitled to have regard.It is likely that MsHamilton had other information available to heras to the incident, as theRegister record does not refer to theMental Health (ForensicProvisions) Act. No suggestion was made in either of the responses tothe Investigation Determinationthat there was any inaccuracy in relation to theaccount of theGlebeincident, so far as it went. Again, it is unsurprising that Ms Nelson made no reference to the incident in her reasons.Ground bThe allegation contained in ground b has been set out at [24] above. TheCouncil treated this somewhat obscure ground as seeking to rely upon the principle of manifest unreasonableness as a form of jurisdictional error. There was, as theCouncil further submitted, no basis for upholding such a ground. The issuesbefore theCouncil officers in making the menacing dog declaration werethe nature andcircumstancesof the Rozelle incident. The owner of Maisy had given explicit details which supported the view that Rockstar had made an unprovokedattack on Maisy. His account also supported the view that Maisy had been bittenin the course ofthe attack. As the plaintiff declined to be interviewed, and as theonly availableaccount was not inherently implausible, it is unsurprising thatitwas accepted. The investigation was, on its face, thorough and the result, if not inevitable, wasnot unreasonable. There was no basis to find that it was manifestly unreasonablein the legal sense.There might, on one view, be an alternative understanding of ground b, namely an allegation that the officers had failed totake into accounta mandatory consideration.On the latterapproach,the referenceinground bto the timing of the28 July submissionmay have beenintended to imply that the28 July submissionhad not beentaken into account. However,that was patently false. MsNelson addressed it paragraph by paragraphin her reasons for determining that a menacing dog declaration should be made.Onematterthe28 July submissiondid not address was the Glebe incident.The reference to the“additional affidavit”wasidentified in oral submissions as a reference to an affidavit filed on 13 December 2023.That added no admissible material to that exhibited to the plaintiff’s affidavit filed on 8September 2023 and was rejected.However,reading thereferenceas beingto the8 September 2023 affidavitread in this proceeding, andeven if there were some unidentified errorsin the records for Rockstar on theRegister, those were errors which were required to be identified to the decision-maker and are not a matter for assessment by this Court.On either reading of ground b, it did not identify a jurisdictional error,nor any errorpermitting review.Extension of timeAs explained above, the summons seeking judicial review was not filed within the time provided under UCPR,r 59.10. Although there was no notice of motion, the plaintiff accepted that she needed an extension of time and sought one orally. The first question is as to what datethe extension is required.The first summons was filed on 5 September 2023. It contained a long explanation of the background to the commencement of proceedings (which, if relevant, should have been in an affidavit). It identified orders sought under theJudiciary Act 1903(Cth) and identified grounds by setting out provisions from theAdministrativeDecisions (Judicial Review) Act 1997(Cth). No particulars of the grounds were provided. All that can be said is that it correctly identified the decision to be reviewed. It was not in a form which warranted the grant of an extension of time as it clearly required wholesale amendment.A secondsummonswas filed on 18 October 2023 in similar form, but identifying the Council, rather than its officers, as the appropriate defendant. The grounds still lacked specificity and thus failed to comply withUCPR,r 59.4(c). As with the earlier summons, the necessary extension of time would not have been granted had itthenbeen sought.The amended summons filed on 27 March 2024, which was listed for hearing,broadlycomplied with the rules and would be the appropriate subject for an order extending time.There is much to be said for the view put forward by the Council thateventheamendedsummons was so misconceived and lacking in substance that, when combined withthe absence ofan explanationforthe delay in commencing proceedings,itwould warrant refusal of the necessary extension of time. However, there are three reasons for not taking that approach. First, the delay caused no prejudice to the Council, nor to the public interest,in circumstances where the declaration has been effective and in force throughout the period of two years since it was made.It is also fair to say that, at least since 5 September 2023, the Council was on notice that its declaration might be reviewed.Secondly, whilst the medical evidence in support of the plaintiff’s psychological difficulties is sparse, it is sufficient to explain in part the delay.(The plaintiff’s dealings with the Federal Court, informally recounted in the first summons, provide no plausible explanation for the delay.)Thirdly, as the matter has now proceeded to a hearing, and can be disposed of on the merits, no purpose is served by refusing an extension of time.Before leaving the matter, it is appropriate to record thatseveralfurther emails were received bymy associatefrom the plaintiff after judgment was reserved. Such communications are inappropriateand do not require a response. However, one matter should be addressed. In an email sent at 4.45pm on Wednesday, 14 August,the plaintiff assertedthat I had said in Court that I would“adjourn the matter for 28 more days if [the plaintiff] could obtain a lawyer by then”. That misstated the exchangewhich was as follows:[17]“His Honour:The only reason I would adjourn it would be the possibility that within the next 28 days you found a lawyer to represent you.Plaintiff:That wouldn’t be a possibility atall, becauseI’m waiting – I’ve got no money for that.His Honour:Yes.Sowe go ahead.Plaintiff:Well, the thing is – the other thing –His Honour:I’m not proposing to adjourn it. I’ll refuse your application to vacate the hearing.”If the Court were to infer that the plaintiff was making an application to reopen the order made (and entered) yesterday to refuse the application to vacate the hearing, that application should be refused. Not onlytherea misapprehension as to what was said in Court (and I appreciate that the plaintiffdidnot have the transcript and may not have understood what was said at the time)but it is now clear that the proceeding was bound to fail.OrdersFor these reasons the Court makes the following orders:Extend the time for filing a summons seeking judicial review up to and including27March 2024.Dismiss the amended summons filed on 27 March 2024.Order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs in this Court.**********Endnotes1.Companion Animal Act, s 51(1A).2.Companion Animal Act, s 41.3.Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), (UCPR), r 59.10.4.Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656; [1986] HCA 7.5.Supreme Court Act, s 69(3).6.Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 564, 580-581 (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron JJ); [1992] HCA 10.7.Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd (1986) 162 CLR 24, 40 (Mason J); [1986] HCA 40.8.Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning (1947) 74 CLR 492; [1947] HCA 21 (Browning).9.Browning at 505 (Dixon J); Peko-Wallsend at 40 (Mason J); Lo v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (2013) 85 NSWLR 86; [2013] NSWCA 180 at [9].10.Companion Animals Act, s 80(4); Regulation, cl 31.11.Regulation, cl 31(3) and (4) (emphasis added).12.Companion Animals Act, s 83.13.See also Regulation, cl 30.14.(2015) 255 CLR 352; [2015] HCA 7 (ACMA v Today FM).15.ACMA at [33] (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).16.Referring to a power to dispose of a summary offence under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), referred to below.17.Tcpt, 14/08/24, p 10(34)-(45).DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Theplaintiffs submitted that the defendant should pay the costs of the whole proceedings and the defendant submitted that the plaintiffs should pay his costs after 12 April 2024.At the hearingon 11 July 2024, it was not in issue that, since the offer of compromise was made under UCPR r20.26, theorder for the defendantto pay costsincluded in the offer of compromisereferredonlyto the costs up to the time the offer was made, that is 12 April 2024, as explained by Rein J inThe Owners Corporation Strata Plan No 74667; 74670 and 74662 v Auburn City Council[2015] NSWSC 86at [14].Nonetheless, it was notedby Mr White of counsel, who appeared for the plaintiffs, that Rein J had also saidin that caseat [21]:“Whilst I accept that the Court does have an inherent power in relation to costs of wide scope, to impose a costs obligation on an offeror different to that which the offeree has accepted by a process of offers of compromise pursuant to rule 26 and the consequential rule 20.27 (or rule 42.13A if that were applicable), would be a surprising outcome and I think it would only be in exceptional circumstances that the Court would exercise that power…”.Mr White contended that there were exceptional circumstances in the present case which would justify making an order for additional costs against the defendant beyond what he had agreed to by accepting the offer of compromise under r20.26.

At about 1:25pm on that day, a landslide or rockfall occurred adjacent to the Track. All but Avan Elena Alice Nazir were struck by debris from the landslide or rockfall.MehraabMinoo Nazir and Zain Julian James Nazir were killedas a result ofbeing struck by the debris.Mehraabwas the husband of Anastasia Victoria Ruth Nazir and the father of Zain, Avan and Zahran Rex Haydn Nazir. Both Anastasia and Zahran were injuredas a resultofthe landslide or rockfall. Avan was present and witnessed the death and injury of the other members of the family.On 27 September 2023 Anastasia, Avan and Zahran commenced proceedings against the State of New South Wales. Anastasia does so as the widow ofMehraaband brings the action pursuant to s 3 of theCompensation to Relatives Act 1897(NSW) for the benefit of herself and on behalf of Avan and Zahran. She also brings proceedings for personal injury. Zahran seeks damages for personal injury,and Avan brings an action for mental harm as a close family member of the deceased,of Anastasia and Zahran,within the meaning of s 30(5) of theCivil Liability Act 2002(NSW).The State of New South Wales is sued on the basis that it had the care and control of the Blue Mountains National Park through its agency the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).This judgment is concerned with a dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendant in relation toa number ofsubpoenas issued by the plaintiffs. On 20 October 2023 a subpoena was issued to the NSW Police seeking the following documents:1.A copy of this subpoena and completed Notice of Declaration.2.All documents held by NSW Police relating to the incident and subsequent investigation arising out of an accident involving theNazirfamily on4 April 2022in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales. Including but not limited to:a.Incidentreport;bPolice aerial and scene photos; andc.Statement of William Baston(sic).The Police produced documents on 15 March 2024 including statements of Jared Cox dated 5 May 2022, MonicaNugent dated 30 June 2022, Kate Mulligan dated 29 June 2022 and William Batson dated sometime in 2022. By a notice of motion dated 2 June 2024 thedefendantseeks that access to thosestatementsnot begranted to the plaintiffs because the statements are subject to legal professional privilege held by the defendant.Four subpoenas were filed and served by the plaintiffs as follows:Subpoena to NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment(the Department)filed 25 October 2023 (the first subpoena);Subpoena to NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment filed 6 February 2024 (the second subpoena);Subpoena to NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water filed 22 March 2024 (the third subpoena); andSubpoena to NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water filed 12 June 2024 (the fourth subpoena).By notice of motion filed 25 June 2024 the plaintiffs seek that the documents referredtoin the four subpoenas be produced to the Court and that the plaintiffs be granted access to those documents.I was informed at the outset of the hearing that thedefendant’s notice of motion had been resolved. Thedefendantagreed that the plaintiffs should have access to the statements produced by the police.Thedefendantnowonlyobjects to the production of a geotechnical report called the Wentworth Pass Geotechnical Investigation Report dated 29 July 2022 (the Report). This was a report prepared pursuant to a letter from the Department dated 11 April 2022.The relevantchronology appears to be as follows:4 April 2022, landslide or rockfall occurs.5 April 2022, email from David Crust, an officer ofthe Departmenttopersonnel in the Department and the Environmental Protection Authority,which relevantly said this:•Update on situation this morning:•Will Batson is at police command post at Wentworth Falls•Police have walked into the accident site to commence the retrieval operation…•Jared Cox from our track team has gone in with the police rescue team. Jared will assist police and take photographs of the accident site••The police will fly over the accident site on the way out with a drone and will share their footage with us•We have a Geotech engineer on standby to analyse the footage. We will consider him accessing the site tomorrow if conditions allow for a more detailed site assessment.6 April 2022, the Department instructedLeighton Hawkes atMcCabesSolicitors,to advise in relation to the incident and act for it in respect of any future litigation which may arise including anticipated civil legal proceedings and coronial proceedings.7 April 2022, statement by the Premier, Dominic Perrottet, that he would be seeking advice as to whether theTrack should have been open given recent heavy rain. In addition, a statement was reported in the press on7 April 2022 by the Department that the area was closed to the public until further notice“and a‘comprehensive review’would be undertaken”.11 April 2022, letter of instruction from the Department to Jacobs Engineering Group.29 July 2022, geotechnical report by the Jacobs Engineering Group.27 September 2023, commencement of proceedings by the plaintiffs.9 May 2024, letter from theCoronerto the plaintiffs’solicitor informing them that no inquest would be held.InSparks, in the matter of IG Energy Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed)[2024] FCA 613DerringtonJ set out principles of legal professional privilege,relying on what had been said by Beach J inRobertson v Singtel Optus Pty Ltd[2023] FCA 1392. JusticeDerringtonsaid at [50]:(d)At [88] of his Honour's reasons, it was observed that, in determining whether a communication was made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice, it is convenient to apply the principles stated inAWB Ltd v Cole (No 5)(2006) 155 FCR 30 [44] (AWB v Cole), which were restated and elaborated on inAsahi Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd v Pacific Equity Partners Pty Ltd (No 4)[2014] FCA 796 [28] - [44]. They include the following:(i)In order to establish the dominant purpose “focused and specific evidence is required in respect of each communication, rather than mere generalised assertion let alone opaque and repetitious verbal formulae.”(ii)The relevant time for ascertaining purpose is when the communication was made or when a written document came into existence.(iii)“[T]he relevant purpose may be either that of the author or initiator of the communication, or the person at whose request or under whose authority the communication was created or made.The circumstances will dictate the focus.”(iv)The purpose of the communication is that which is objectively ascertained, even though the subjective intention of the author or person requesting the creation of the document may be significant.(v)The content of a communication is relevant in the assessment of its purpose and may carry great weight.(vi)A practical test in ascertaining purpose is to ask whether the communication would have been made irrespective of the obtaining of legal advice.This involves identifying the intended uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence.(vii)It is undoubted that legal professional privilege can attach to a document produced by a third-party adviser to a client who seeks to use it for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.In this context, the purpose can readily be inferred by the directness of the communication from thethird partyadviser to the client's lawyer.(viii)Where third party advisers do work and communicate with a person in a non-litigation context, it is necessary to analyse the precise purpose of each communication. Non-legaladviceswill rarely be capable of attracting legal professional privilege for the reason that they will almost invariably have the character of discrete advices to the principals.(ix)Even where a client contemplates acquiring the non-legal advice also for the purpose of submitting to legal advisers, that may merely demonstrate that it has been acquired for a multiplicity of purposes.Whilst these were said to be principles at common law, they are equally relevant for a consideration of legal professional privilege under theEvidence Act 1995(NSW)(the Act). The present consideration is governed by theActby reason of s 131A. That is becausethe defendant, whois the party to whom the subpoena is addressed,who is resisting access being granted on the ground of legal professional privilege(or“client legal privilege”as theActcalls it).The plaintiffs submitted that the Report was not prepared for the dominant purpose of seeking or being furnished with legal advice byMcCabesor for the purpose of legal services being provided related to anticipatedproceedings.The defendant claims the Report is privileged on both bases, pursuant to ss118 and 119 of theAct.The plaintiffs pointed to sub-paragraph[50](d)(i) ofSparkstosubmit that what Mr Hawkes said about his instructions were mere general assertion, and that more was needed to show that his requesting theReportwas for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice or in anticipation of legal proceedings.Thedefendanthad made available to the solicitors for the plaintiffs a redacted form of the letter of instructions to the Jacobs Engineering Group of 11 April 2022. The redacted form of the letter contained only standard information in relation to compliance with theExpert Witness Code, instructions that the report and any drafts were to be confidential to the Department andmade referenceto matters concerning fees. The redacted form of the letter threw no light on the question of legal professional privilege.The parties agreed, however, that the unredacted form of the letter should be made available to the Court to assist in determining whether legal professionalprivilege was correctly claimed for the contents of theReport. The unredacted letter was marked as“Confidential Exhibit”and has not been disclosedto the plaintiffs or their lawyers or to any other person.Notwithstanding the redacted form of the letter of instructions, Mr Hawkes disclosed a further portion of the letter in his affidavit as follows:NPWS has instructed the Department of Planning and Environment’s Legal Division to provide legal advice in relation to the incident. For the purposes of obtaining that legal advice, it is necessary for NPWS to conduct an internal investigation into the incident and to provide a report on the Investigation to the Legal Division. The need for both the Investigation and the DPE advice, is that there is a high probability of future litigation arising from the incident, including a Coronial Inquest and Civil claims.The plaintiffs submitted thata number ofmatters, when considered in combination, demonstrated that the dominant purpose of obtaining the Report was not either for the purpose of obtaining legal advice nor for the purpose of acting in anticipated legal proceedings. The first matter was the statement of the Premier that he would be seeking advice as to whether the Track should have been open on the day concerned, together with the Department’s public statement that a comprehensive review would be undertaken. Secondly, the plaintiffs pointed to the statement in the email of David Crust that the Department had a Geotech engineer on standby to analyse the footage received from the police, and the consideration that the engineer would be admitted to the site to provide a more detailed assessment.Thirdly, the plaintiffsrelied on what Mr Hawkes said in the above extract from his letter of instructions about the need for an internal investigation.The plaintiffs submitted that those matters demonstrated that the purpose of the report was related to matters of public safety and not for a legal purpose.Alternatively, there were two purposes, and the dominant purpose was not a legal one.In that regard,the plaintiffs pointed to what was said byDerringtonJ inSparks, that a practical test in ascertaining purpose is to ask whether the communication would have been made irrespective of the obtaining of legal advice. The plaintiffs submitted that in the light of what was said by the Premier,the Department and by Mr Crust, it was evident that the report would have been sought regardlessof the likelihood of the need to obtain legal advice.The plaintiffssubmitted that litigation privilege did not extend to coronial proceedings.In my opinion, thedefendantadequately demonstrates that the dominant purpose of the obtaining of the Report was for the provision of legal advice to the Department and in anticipation of likely legal proceedings. It was inevitablethat theCoronerwould be involved because two people were killed. There was a reasonable prospect that an inquest would be held. It was also more likely than not that civil proceedings would be instituted by reason of the death and injuries suffered to members of the Nazir family.Secondly, Mr Hawkes was instructed on the 6 April 2022 to advice in relation to the incident and to act in any future litigation. His letter of instructions to Jacobs Engineering Group was forwarded some five dayslater on11 April 2022. I am entirely satisfied from the terms of the unredacted letter, (and, indeed, even from that portion of the letter disclosed by Mr Hawkes at [17] above)that the Report was sought from the Jacobs Group for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice to the Department and in acting in relation to either or both coronial and civil proceedings arising from the incident.The report from the Jacobs Group was not the only geotechnical advice sought by the Department. A letter from theCoronerto the plaintiffs’solicitors makes clear that another company, Pells SullivanMeynink, provided“geotechnical and engineering services to develop their current risk management strategies and current policy concerning landslide risks”of the NPWS.That is likely to be the company referred to in Mr Crust’s email because at that date (5 April 2022) the Jacobs Group had not been retained.Whilst I accept that it is likely geotechnical advice and a report would have been sought into the causes of the incident irrespective of the obtaining of legal advice, that is not a sufficient answer to the claim for legal professional privilegeover the Report.First,as noted above, other geotechnical experts had been engaged. Secondly,it is entirely artificial to consider that no legal proceedings could have been anticipated in the light of an incident such as the one that occurred. TheCoronerwas always going to be involved even if no inquest was held.Thirdly,the principle stated byDerringtonJin [50](d)(vi) ofSparkswas qualified by saying,“this involves identifying the intended uses of the document which accounted for it being brought into existence”. The terms of the letter of instructions point strongly to theReport being sought for the purpose of legal advice and for the use in anticipated proceedings.In my opinion, legal professional privilege attaches if the dominant purpose was for the client being provided with legal services relating to an inquest. Section 119 of the Act provides:LitigationEvidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of-(a) a confidential communication between the client and another person, or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person, that was made, or(b) the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was prepared,for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceeding, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been, a party.The term“Australian or overseas proceeding”is defined in the Dictionary of the Act as meaning,a proceeding (however described) in an Australian court or a foreign court.The term“Australian court”is defined as meaning (relevantly):(e) a person or body authorised by an Australian law, or by consent of parties, to hear, receive and examine evidence,A Coroner’s court is such a body. The fact that the laws of evidence do not apply to such a court or that the proceedings are not adversarial would not appear to exclude it from the definition. By contrast, para (f) of the definition refers to,a person or body that, in exercising a function under an Australian law, is required to apply the laws of evidence.The plaintiffs’submissionsmake referenceto the decision of Bergin J (as her Honour then was) inIngot Capital Investments Pty Limited v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd(2006) 67 NSWLR 91; [2006] NSWSC 530 at [54]-[55] where it was held that proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were not“proceedings”within the meaning of theActbecause the AAT did not involve the exercise of judicial power.No reference was made in the reasons to the definitions in the Dictionary set out above.I do not consider thatIngot Capital Investmentsis authority that s 119 of the Act doesnot apply in respect of proceedings in the Coroner’s Court. I am satisfied, in any event, that the retainer of Mr Hawkes and the letter of instructions to the Jacobs Group demonstrate that the dominant purpose of the Report was for the provision of legal advice and for use in civil proceedings which were more likely than not to have ensued from the incident.In the circumstances, access to the Report should be refused to the plaintiffs.No submissions were made on the question of costs.I have already dismissed the defendant’s notice of motion by consent. By reason of my determination about legal professional privilege, the plaintiffs’motion will also be dismissed. My prima facie view is thatthere should beno order as to costs of either of the motions.

Thewholeepisode resolved gradually overthe period ofabout 10 minutes andOluwatomiwas reported to be“her usual self”when the ambulance arrived.Oluwatomiremained in hospital for observations and investigations. A neurological examination on 27 May 2019 suggested that she may be suffering“paroxysmal events”due toaswallowingoraspiration problem which had beennoted prior to her dischargeto herparents’care on 16 April 2019. However, there was a question about whetherOluwatomiwas suffering“seizures”and a course of investigations were recommended.An ultrasound ofOluwatomi’shead on 29 May 2019 demonstrated a“new left-sided anechoic subdural collection”and raised the possibility of“non-accidental injury”.“New”was by reference to prior radiological investigations before her previous discharge from hospital.Anelectroencephalogram(“EEG”)on the same day was normal.TheCT scan ofOluwatomi’sheadalsoon the same day was suggestive of“bilateral subdural hygromas/chronic subdural haematomas overlying the frontal lobes bilaterally”. There was no acute haemorrhage or skull fracture.These findings were confirmed and more clearly visualised ontheMRI ofOluwatomi’sbrain on 3 June 2019.Oluwatomi’scase was referred to theCPUon 30 May 2019 and she was examined by a CPU Registrar on 31 May 2019. WhenMathew and Olamide wereinterviewed separately at the hospital,“it was explained that the findings were highly concerning for a past injury toOluwatomi’shead”. Neither parent could recall any such injury.In her initial report of 11 June 2019, the forensic paediatrician attached to the CPU expressed the opinion that the distribution of the subdural hygromas were consistent with an acceleration-deceleration (shaking) injury. Not all of the clinical signs were consistent with thisopinion, but as the radiological appearances of the haematomas were suggestive of chronic injury and were not present on MRI performed atthe age of10 days,it was thought thatother clinical signs consistent with ashaken babyinjury may have dissipated.Thepaediatriciansaid shaking injuries produced immediately apparent symptoms of the type reported by the parents upon presentation at theemergencydepartment on 12 May 2019.Thepaediatricianconcluded:“In summary,Oluwatomi’spresentation with unexplained chronic bilateral subdural haemorrhages was highly concerning for a past inflicted (shaking) injury to her head”.As a result of the report of 11 June 2019 apolice investigation by the Child Abuse Unit was commenced andMathew and Olamidewere interviewed by police separately at the Children’sHospital. The investigation was suspended on 17 June 2019 becauseOluwatomi’sinjuries could not beaccuratelydated,or their origin confirmed. Therewasno sufficient evidence supportingaconclusion that she had been assaulted.The officer in charge of the investigation considered thatMathew and Olamidehad given consistent versions ofOluwatomi’sprogress and of the incident of 12 May 2019.On 11 June 2019, ateleconferencehad beenheld amongst interested government agencies, including the forensic paediatrician. The specialist adhered to her opinion, but stated,“she was unable to rule out the possibility[the injury]was caused at one of the hospitals [Oluwatomi] had been in since birth”.The police reportrecorded:“[Oluwatomi] has only spent 3 weeks in her4 monthlife at home, at the end of April 2019. The injuries detected cannot be linked to this period of when [she] returned home.While [the forensic paediatrician] has stated the injuries are likely caused from a “shaking” motion, she stated there is a possibility, [Oluwatomi’s] other medical conditions may have exacerbated the injuries and caused them to occur from a less severe action.”The publication relied on byMathew and Olamidetofoundtheir proposeddefamation action is a second report from the same forensic paediatrician of 14 August 2019 (Affidavit,Eun Sil Choi,6 November 2023). The report was provided to answer questionsraised bythe DCJ Case Work Manager of the Central Metropolitan Joint Child Protection Response Program(“JCPRP”). It was to be read in conjunction with the report of 11 June 2019 to which I have already referred to. After a summary of the various accounts given by the parents on various dates on and after 12 May 2019 as to the onset ofOluwatomi’scondition on 12 May 2019, the forensic paediatrician expressed the following opinion:“The symptoms described are all symptoms that have been described by carers who have admitted to shaking a baby. These carers report that the symptoms are immediately apparent after the shaking injury event.The findings on imaging ofOluwatomi’shead could be explained by a shaking injury having occurred on 12 May 2019 at the time that the symptoms occurred as reported byOluwatomi’sparents”.I interpolate the obvious implication is one or other parent must have been responsible for any such shaking injury.As a result of the provision of the report of 14 August 2019, the JCPRP found that the allegations thatMathew and Olamidehad physically harmedOluwatomiwere substantiated. The relevant harm was the shaking injury resulting in a brain injuryand Mathew and Olamide“were listed asPersonsCausingHarm”.Mathew and Olamidewere given a copy of the report of 14 August 2019 on or about 28 August 2019 and from thenon,over the following period of approximately 2 years, Mathewmaderepeatedcomplaints concerning the outcome of the CPU’s investigationand the findings of the JCPRPto the DCJ and eventually the responsible minister as well as to the Health Care Complaints Commission(“HCCC”). The complaints to the HCCC were dismissed. But eventually hispersistencegained traction with the DCJ.Without attempting to summarise all of the material Mathewraised in support of his complaints, pertinent matters include clinical notes from the Children’s Hospital at Westmead documentingincidents of eye rolling,raising concerns about the possibility of seizures beforeOluwatomi’soriginal discharge on 19 April 2019. These documents were two records made bydifferent,individual junior medical officers on16 April 2019. The second of these,notes by Dr Gunaratne,recorded asfindings on examination,“intermittently rolling eyes back (noted during feed,was thought to be potential seizure)”. There was no“work of breathing”recorded on that occasionas was the case upon re-admission on 12 May 2019. The second matter was the opinion of a neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Lin,who apparently examined the MRI of 3 June2019and expressed the view thatat least one ofthe subdural hematomas shown on the imaging was more than 28 days old. This opinion made it unlikely that any incident of shakingOluwatomioccurred on or about 12 May 2019.There is an unresolved question in the clinical material about when Dr Linformed this view.As a result ofMathew’spersistence, on 5 July 2021 (Affidavit, Eun SilChoi,6 November 2023,Exhibit F), the responsible minister acknowledged Mathew’s“ongoing concerns about the medical records available at the time of the JCPRP assessment”. Hesaid hehad requested an independentforensic analysis of the medical evidence considered in assessing“safety and risk toOluwatomi”. There was also a concern that Mathew’scomplaints had not been escalated appropriately, for which the minister apologised.The review was carried out by an investigator in DCJ’s Reportable Conduct Unit(“RCU”).The report was prepared on 22 July 2021 and counter-signed by theDirector, Child Safety and Review. On his analysis,theinvestigatorconcluded that the clinical records indicate thatOluwatomi’sinjury could have occurred at any time between 27 March 2019 and 12May 2019. This, however, needed to be considered in the context of the opinion ofDrLin that at least the left sided haematoma contained blood older than 28 days, meaning the injury he identified was unlikely to have occurred after 7 May 2019. Theinvestigatornoted that there was no evidence of any consultation between Dr Lin and the forensic paediatrician. Theinvestigatoralso acknowledged Mathew’sreliance upon the medical records dated16April 2019,“potentially referring to the same observation [documenting] that seizures were suspected on 15 April 2019”. There are no available records demonstrating whether there was further investigation at that time. The possibility thatOluwatomi’sinjury occurred prior to discharge on 19 April 2019 was recognised by the investigator. The investigator concluded that“based on the available information, the review is unable to provide a timeframe that isolates the injury or injuries to a specific period of care, or individual’s care”. It was recommended that furtherinformation be sought from the forensic paediatrician.From a written briefing document prepared on the consideration of the Deputy Secretary DCJ on or about 16 October 2021, it is clear that further comments were soughtfromand providedby theforensic paediatricianwhoadhered to her previous views.From Dr Lin’s opinion,she considered thatthere may have been more than one injurious episode. Thisincreasedherconcern aboutOluwatomi’sparents.However, the author of the briefing paper recommended that the finding thatMathew and Olamidephysically harmedOluwatomiby shaking her causing a brain injury was substantiated and the listing of them as Persons Causing Harm should be redetermined in their favour with an end date of 29 September 2021 when the review was completed. The original complaint or“issue”should be recorded as“Not Substantiated”. It is not necessary for present purposes to summarise the reasons for this recommendation, which was subsequently approved by the responsible senior officer.Suffice it to say that the review found insufficient grounds from the original assessmentto support the“substantiated”outcome. The results of theRCUreview were summarised. A specific finding was made thatMathewcould not have been recorded as a person causing harmasthe JCPRP assessment indicated that it was highly unlikely thatMathewcaused harm toOluwatomi. He had been assessed as being a person able to provide safety toOluwatomiprior to her being discharged on 19 April 2019 into herparents’care. I infer that it was unlikely thatOlamidewould cause harm toOluwatomias,in her husband’s absence for work,DCJ organisedadditionalservices to supportOlamide. Finally, it was recorded Mathew and Olamidehavetwoolder children and there had been no reportsbefore or sinceabout the family. It was found thattheyhave demonstrated that they pose no further risk to their children.By letter dated 1 November 2021 forwarded by email, the DirectorJCPRP stated:“JCPRP has determined that in light of the new information provided by you and the associated inconsistencies and time frames, there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the balance of probabilities that you are persons who caused harm to your child.This means that your names and contact details will be end dated as a Person Causing Harm on the Department of Communities and Justice data base. The end date will be backdated to 29 September 2021 which is the date the review was endorsed.I would like to apologise for any distress that the original decision has caused you and acknowledge that the review process has taken some time to complete.”I should also recordfor completenessthat the evidence before me establishes that when the Police Child Protection Unit was contacted during the review, the suspension of the investigation waslifted,and the filewasreferred to another officer for internal review. There is no further information about the outcome of thepolice review. However,there is nothing to suggest that any adversepolice action has been taken.As I have said, the originalstatement ofclaim was filed on 1 April 2022. As part of the relief soughtMathew and Olamidesought damages“for the defendant’s act of defamation”. Paragraphs[76]to[83]of the pleading set outMathew andOlamide’scontentions in relation to defamation referring“particularly”to the forensic paediatrician’s“biasedmedical opinion which was inconsistent with medicalevidence,and which was not based on any medical evidenceandled to the namingofthe plaintiffs as persons causing harm in DCJ’s website”. It was averred thattheir reputation has sufferedgreatly,and they had suffered emotional and financial damage attempting to get DCJ to review its decision and clear their name.Paragraphs [26] to [34] of thestatement ofclaim plead the facts ofthereportsto the CPU, police and DCJ. It is clear from these passages thatthe opinion of the forensic paediatrician is impugned. While no specific mention of the report of 14 August 2019 appears, it is apparent the allegation is that the forensic paediatrician“deliberately gave out false and misleading information to the team of officers from New South Wales Police and Department of Communities and Justice”. The pleadings set out in detail the steps taken to have the substantiated report reversed.Applications to bedeterminedThis judgment deals with two notices of motion heardtogether. The first motion isMathew and Olamide’smotion containing two prayers for relief. The first is for an order for an extension of timenuncprotuncto commence defamation proceedings by 18 September 2023. The second is an order granting leave to file the proposedamendedstatement ofclaim as an amendment of the pleading first filed on 1 April 2022.The defendant’s motion filed on 15 September 2023 seeks the following substantive prayer for relief:“If an order is made pursuant to s 56A of theLimitation Act 1969(NSW) and leave is granted to Mr MatthewOnakoyaand Mrs OlamideOnakoyato file the proposed amended statemen of claim appearing at Exhibit 2 to MrOnakoya’saffidavit affirmed 22 June 2023 (PSOC) (whichthe defendant opposes), the PSOC should be struck out pursuant to UCPR 14.28(1)(a) or (d) or dismissed pursuant to UCPRI 13.4(1)(b)”.The issues are:mustleave to extend time be refused becausethe maximumperiodduring which time may be extended under s 56A,i.e.,three yearsfrom the date of publication,hasexpired;in the alternative,whetherthe plaintiffs have established the statutory condition for the exercise of the court’s discretion to extend time“that it was not reasonable in the circumstancesfor the plaintiff to have commenced the action within the limitation period of 1 year from the date of publication”;shouldthe proposedamendedstatement ofclaim be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action orashaving a tendency tocause prejudice, embarrassment or delay;andwhetherthe proceedings for defamation should be summarily dismissed onGeneral Steel Industries Inc. v Commissioner for Railways(1964) 112 CLR 125; [1964] HCA 69principles.Relevant statutory provisionsKey provisions of theLimitation Act 1969(NSW)(the“Act”)referrable to actionsfordefamation were amended by theDefamation Amendment Act 2020(NSW).Those amendments, however, apply in relation to the publication of defamatory matter after the commencement of the amendmentson 1 July 2021: Sch 5,Pt4,cll11(1),(4). The present case continues to be governed, therefore, by the Act as it stoodon14 August 2019, the date of the publication upon whichMathew and Olamidesue.By s 14Bof the Act,an action on a cause of action for defamation is not maintainable if brought after the end of a limitation period of 1 year, running from the date of the publication of the matter complained of. Clearly, this action was not so brought. Section 56Aof the Actempowered the Court to extend the limitation period in limited circumstances. The key provisionwass 56A(2). It provided:“A Court must, if satisfied that it was not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiffto havecommenced an action in relation to the matter complained of within 1 year from the date of the publication, extend the limitation period mentioned in s 14B to a period of up to 3 years running from the date of the publication.”By s 56D, an order for the extension ofthelimitation period may be madenuncprotunc“even though the limitation periodhas already expired”.Applicable principlesInAhmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd[2010] NSWSC676 at [28], Simpson J(as her Honour then was)pointed out that s 56A differed somewhat from those provisions permitting the extension of a limitation provision on just and reasonable groundsorprovidingsome other flexible exception to the period of limitation. Her Honour said:“[Section 56A]differs from such provisions in two respects. Firstly, it requires the plaintiff to prove that it was not reasonable to commence proceedings within time; secondly, far from conferring a discretion on the court to extend time if the plaintiff proves that fact, it obliges the court to extend time. Extension, in those circumstances, is mandatory.”InRitsonv Gay and Lesbian Community Publishing Limited[2012] NSWSC 483 at [14]-[15], Beech-Jones J(as his Honour then was)explained the difficult task facing a plaintiff required to prove that it was not reasonable to bring the action within the limitation period in the following terms:“First, the burden imposed upon a party applicant seeking an extension is a heavy one. It is not sufficient for them to prove that it was reasonable for them to delay commencing proceedings. Rather they are driven to demonstrating that it was not reasonable for them to start within the12 monthperiod (Ahmedat [39]). Not surprisingly this has been described as a \"difficult hurdle\" (Rayneyat [41]) and one which can only be satisfied in \"relatively unusual circumstances\" (Noonanat [15], per Keane JA).Second, the test is an objective one requiring a consideration of the circumstances \"as they appear objectively to the court\" (Noonanat [20], per Keane JA). Ignorance on the part of the plaintiff as to the time limits specified cannot afford a reasonable basis for not commencing proceedings (Noonanat [22] per Keane JA). However, this does not mean that the plaintiff's motivations or thought processes are irrelevant (Careyat [46] to [48]). InCareyMcCallum J approved the following as a statement of the correct approach (at [48]):\" .... the test requires attention to the plaintiff's actual reasons, as they are a vital part of the circumstances pertinent to whether it was reasonable or not to bring to the proceedings within the nominated period.\"”(Rayneyis a reference toRayneyv State of Western Australia (No 3)[2010] WASC 83;NoonantoNoonan v MacLennan[2010] 2QdR537; [2010] QCA 50; andCareytoCarey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation(2012) 84 NSWLR 90; [2012] NSWCA 176).The principles enunciated by Simpson J and Beech-Jones J are the same as those expressed inBarrett v TCN Chanel 9 Pty Ltd(2017) NSWLR 478;[2017] NSWCA 304(perMcColl JA at [69]-[84];Simpson JA agreeing at [108]; and Payne JA at [114] and [117]).InBarrett,McColl JA(at [71]-[72])emphasised that the“not reasonable test”is a difficult one to satisfy. Normally it will require the applicant to establish something“relatively unusual”,“special”or“compelling”:Noonanat [67] (perChesterman JA).Her Honour also pointed out that while satisfaction of the“not reasonable test”mandates an extension of time, the court retains a general discretion as to the period of extension allowed:Barrettat [75]. As the purpose of theAct’sprovisions applying to defamation actionsisrequiring such actions to be brought and determined promptly, as the outcome inBarrettitself demonstrates a plaintiff maytarry too long after the expiration of the period during which it was not reasonable to commence proceedings such that the extension properly allowable within the maximum period of three years may yet fall short of the date upon which the plaintiff commenced the action so that those proceedings are fatally out of time (Barrettat [91];O’Sullivan v Farrer(1989) 168 CLR 210 at 216; [1989] HCA 61 (perMason CJ, Brennan, Dawson andGaudronJJ).Given that the defendant has raised theGeneral Steelprinciples in argument, I think it well to observe that I am not aware of any authority dealing with the question whether the legal bounds of the general discretion permit a refusal of the express statutory mandate to extend time notwithstanding the satisfactionof the“not reasonable test”on the ground that the action is clearly untenable in theGeneral Steelsense. In a different limitation of action context, it would not be“just and reasonable”to permit an action to proceed unless the plaintiff demonstrated by evidence led on the application for extension of time that the action had at least some prospect of success at final hearing:cfDrayton Coal Pty Ltd v Drain[1995] NSWCA 131.The first issue– the applicability of the long stop limitation periodI understood Ms Roberts ofcounsel, who appears for the defendant,to argue thatMathew and Olamide’saction for defamation was fatally flawed because no proceedings claiming damages for defamation had been properly commenced before the filing of the proposed amended statement of claimreferrable to the defamation claim (Exhibit 2) on 22 June 2023. This was beyond what might be described as the s 56A“long stop”limitation period of 3 yearsfrom the date of publication. This argument is premised upon the establishment of thefactthat the statement of claim filed byMathewon 1 April 2022 did not articulate a claim for defamation.Clearly the PSOC was not filed within 3 years of the date of publication of the impugned report of the forensic paediatrician.I am not persuaded that this argument is correct.In my view, while the statement of claim filed on 1 April 2022 was irregular because itjoinedOluwatomi’spersonal injuries claim andMathew and Olamide’sdefamation claim in the one proceedings,and did not comply with the requirements for pleading and particularising a claim for damages for defamation,in my view it did, in substance, seek to raise adefamationclaim not only by articulating such a claim in the prayers for relief, but also by pleading facts upon which it was advancedin those passages in the statement of claim to which I have referred to above (at [23]-[24]).Whiler14.30(1)Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW)was contravened because allegations were made that the matter complained of was“false”, andr14.30(2) was not complied with, the substance of the complaint was cleari.e.,that the forensic paediatrician expressed the opinion thatMathew and Olamidewere persons who caused harm to their baby daughter. It has now been made clear by way of furtherandbetter particulars that the publication relied upon is the more extensive report of 14 August 2019 which incorporates the earlier report of 11 June 2019. Clearly, as Ms Roberts has correctly pointed out, theoriginal statement of claim and the proposed amended statement of claim are also irregular by the failure to draft them in compliance with the provisions of Div 4 ofPt15UCPRand in particularr15.19, a matter to which I will return. But I am not satisfied that the plaintiff’s action for defamation is not salvageable because it is necessarily beyond the powers conferred on the Court by s 56Aof the Act.The second issue – was it not reasonable in the circumstances for the plaintiff’s to have commenced the action within 1 year ofpublicationAs I have made clear,Mathewrelies upon the publication of the forensicpaediatrician’sreport of 14 August 2019, a copy of which, it is common ground, was provided to him under cover of an email dated 28 August 2019. As I have stated, the report of 14 August 2019 incorporated the earlier report of 11 June 2019. On the basis of the later report, the JCPRP found that the allegations thatMathew and Olamidehad physicallyharmedOluwatomiwere substantiated.They were publicly listed as Persons Causing Harm.Mathewargues that it was not reasonable for him and his wife to have commenced an action for defamation within 1 year of the 14 August 2019 in all the circumstances as it was a practical necessity for him to have that finding not only set aside, but replaced by a finding that the allegation was not substantiated and to have his and his wife’s names deleted from the list ofPersonsCausingHarm. The exoneration, as it were, of him and his wife did not occur until 16 October 2021 andMathew and Olamidewere not advised of it until they received a letter of the Director JCPRP dated 1 November 2021.It may not have been a legal necessity forMathewto have had the adverse finding against him and his wife reversed before commencing defamation proceedings. Obviously, the facts underpinning the adverse finding could have been challenged in the defamation proceedings. A courtwould nothave beenbound by the administrative action of DCJ. At the same time, there can be no doubt that the defendant, properly advised, would utilise the adverse findings againstMathew and Olamide. At a practical level the adverse findingwould have been a very large obstacle in their path to successfully prosecuting an action for defamation.And the failure to take action to have the record corrected would inevitably have been deployed to the attempted forensic advantage of the defendant.It may be that the adverse finding was not in the same category as an ongoing police investigation,or criminal prosecution for that matter,which may make it not reasonable in the circumstances for a person todelaybringingan action for defamation until the investigation or prosecution is resolved in his or her favour. Here, of course, the police investigation was shut down at an early stage because investigators deemed the evidence to be inconclusive and incapable of supporting a prosecution. Even if that decision had been reviewed in the middle of 2021, nothing seems to have come of that review.But an ongoing police investigation or criminal prosecution cannot be the only circumstance capable of supporting a finding that it was not reasonable to commence an action for defamation within time. The evidence before me, which I have attempted to summarise above under the heading“Background facts”certainly shows that Mathewwas persistent and diligent in locating evidence to undermine the adverse finding and tenacious in articulatinghiscomplaints to DCJ, and other relevant authorities, including theresponsibleminister. Therewasno lack of application on his part.I am of the view that Mathew’spersistence and diligence in pursuing the matter was impressive for a number of reasons. First, his personal circumstancesmustbe appreciated. He and his wife were immigrants from Nigeria working hard to establish themselves in their new homeland. FollowingOluwatomi’sbirth and the emergence of her severe disabilities, it was necessary forOlamideto give up her employment to care for a disabled baby. Mathew and Olamide, as I have pointed out, were already the parents of two young children and the demands of family on them would have been considerable, and considerably timeconsuming,during this period. Mathewwas also in full time employment.Oluwatomi’sdisability had reduced the family situation to the position where he was the sole breadwinner withan onerousburdenoffulltimeworkanddomestic responsibilities.Mathew’stime was doubtless strictly limited. That he was able to pursue and eventually obtain a review of DCJ’s adverse finding against him and his wife is a considerable achievement given the adversities under which he was forced to labour.To my mind, all of these circumstances togethercombineto satisfy the difficult test imposed by s 56Aof the Actby use of the phrase“not reasonable to commence proceedings”within the time limited by s 14Bof the Act.Ifat the practical level the test requires something relatively“unusual”,“special”or“compelling”as expressed inNoonanand applied inBarrett,I am satisfied that these circumstances taken togethersatisfy thattest.Having made this finding, I am required by law to extend the limitation period mentionedin s 14Bof the Act. It remains to exercise the general discretion to determine the length of the extension properly permissible, having regard to the legislative purpose underpinning ss14B and 56A. I have already indicated that I am satisfied that the irregular statement of claimfiled on 1 June 2022clearlyarticulates a claim for damages for defamation on behalf of bothMathew and Olamide. The question is whatthe justice of the situationrequires, bearing in mind the position of each of the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as the statutory purposethat claims for damagesindefamation should be brought and determined relatively promptly. Isanextension to 1 June 2022, a period of some 7 months after the letter of 1 November 2021,too long? I am of the view this is the correctapproach tocrystalising the issue. To proceed otherwise is to adopttooabstract an approach not rooted in the actual circumstances of the case.Mathew’spersonal circumstances had not changed. While he may havebeen able to finda lawyer to assume the carriage ofOluwatomi’sclaim for damages, I am doubtful that he could have readily found a lawyer experienced in medialaworthe like to accept a retainer inthisdefamation action which is bound to have its own difficulties and uncertainties on a“no win,no fee”basis.I do not understand the defendant to assert any forensic prejudice. It is clear that the forensic paediatrician was asked to re-visit the matter in September 2021 by reference to specific issues identified by the investigator reviewing the adverse finding and was able to strongly maintain her original opinion. There is no suggestion of any relevant loss of evidence between 1 November 2021 and 1 June 2022, or subsequently.In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that I should order an extension of time under s 56Aof the Actup to 1 June 2022nuncprotuncunder s 56D of theAct.The third and fourth issues– no disclosure of a reasonable cause of actionSo far as the third issue is concerned, there is no doubt that the proposed amended statement of claim (Exhibit 2) is irregular in as much as it does not comply with the rules that I have already identified(at [38] above),and it should be struck out for that reason alone with a direction that it be re-pleaded in conformity tothe rules. I accept thatMathewhas had more than one opportunity toput the pleadings in order. It is also correctto saythat being self-represented is not a privilege, rather itisa misfortune or at the very least,a disadvantage. However, I am of the view that a further opportunity should be allowed, even if it may be regarded as a last opportunity tobring forward a compliantpleading. It is evident thatMathewis an intelligent man of some intellectual energy and compliance of the rules should not be beyond him. It is required of him in any event. Given his personal circumstances, I would be inclined to permit a fairly generous period of six weeks for this to bedone. Iam not satisfied that the proposed amended statement of claim is otherwise an abuse of process for the purpose of r.14.28UCPR.I will make an order directing that Mathew re-plead.I turn then to the fourth issue which is whether the proceedings should be summarily dismissedas being clearly untenable in accordance with the principles expressed inGeneral Steeland elsewhere.While doubtless there may be other defences which will be pleaded once a compliant statement of claim is brought forward, for this purpose Ms Roberts principally relied upon the provisions of s 245GChildren and Young Persons (Care and Protection Act) 1998(NSW)(“CYP Act”). There is no question thatthe 14 August 2019 report (and the earlier 11 June 2019 report), was prepared in accordance with Chapter 16ACYP Act.Section 245G creates a partial immunity in favour of persons providing information under Chapter 16A. It is in the following terms:“(1) This section applies if a person, acting in good faith, provides any information in accordance with this Chapter.(2)  Any such person is not liable to any civil or criminal action, or any disciplinary action, for providing the information.(3)  In providing the information, the person cannot be held to have breached any code of professional etiquette or ethics or departed from any accepted standards of professional conduct.”It is clear from a reading of the proposed amended statement of claim (Exhibit 2) thatMathewis seeking toanticipate a defence based upon s 245G by impugning the suggestion that the forensic paediatrician was“acting in good faith”. Indeed, an obvious contravention of r 14.30(1)UCPRis that the proposed amended statement of claim is replete with averments, expressed in various ways, that the statements contained in the 14 August 2019 report, which he asserts are defamatory are false and intentionally so. If nothing else, these assertions suggest that there may be a triable issue about s 245GCYP Act.An absence of good faith, or malice, always presents particular difficulties of proof.It seems to me obvious that this will be a very difficult to case forMathewto make out,evenbearing in mind the onusof establishing good faithwill lie upon the defendant. But,on the material available to me, I am unable to conclude that s 245G renders the case ofMathew and Olamideeither clearly untenable or beset by“plain and obvious”deficiencies so that an adverse outcome forMathew and Olamideis the inevitable result.Ms Roberts also invoked the principle expressed by Dixon J(as the Chief Justices then was)inCox vCourneaux(No 2)(1935) 52 CLR 713; [1935] HCA 48at 720 in the following terms:“The inherent jurisdiction of theCourt to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the defendants which may be avoided without risk of injustice to the plaintiff. The principle, in general paramount, that a claim honestly made by a suitor for judicial relief must be investigated and decided in the manner appointed, must be observed.A litigant is entitled to submit for determination according to the due course of procedure, a claim which he believes he can establish, although its foundation may in fact be slender. It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse ofjurisdiction, orwould clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped. ThattheCourtisnot concluded by the manner in which the litigant formulates his case in his pleadings. It may consider the undisputed facts. Further, it is not limited to cases where there is no dispute of fact.”(Citations omitted)Howeverfrom his review of the material put before him, his Honourdecided, notwithstanding the stringency of the test articulated,“that the court should exercise its power to stop the action summarily. The plaintiff’s case is clearly hopeless”.While I have reservations aboutMathew and Olamide’sprospects of success in the defamation action- overall its“foundation”appears“slender”-I am not persuaded that the case is“clearlyhopeless”. Considered in isolation, a statement that necessarily implies that they or one of them was responsible for inflicting traumatic brain injury onOluwatomiby way of“shaken baby syndrome”is clearly defamatory. At this stage,there is no evidence before me of any particular“hardship”fallingon the defendant by permitting the case to proceed in the usual way.Apart from s 245GCYG Act, which does not confer an absolute immunity, no specific defence has been adverted to by the defendant. Given the context in which the report of 14 August 2019wasproduced, it is of course, possible that one or other of the recognised common law or statutory defences underDefamation Act 2005(NSW)will arise. In the absence of a considered formulation of relevant defences, at least defences of qualified privilege andhonest opinion spring to mind. But it wouldbespeculation on my part to purportto summarily dismiss the proceedings on the basis of one or other of those matters, especially having regard to provisions of s 24 of theDefamation Act.Notwithstanding my misgivings, I am not persuaded that the defendant hasdischarged the burden of establishing a case for summary dismissal.OrdersMy orders are:Under ss56A and56DLimitation Act 1969(NSW),extend the time for bringing the action in defamation to the filing of the original statement of claim on 1 April 2022.Under r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW)strike out the proposed amended statement of claim (Exhibit 2) filed on 22 June 2023 and direct the plaintiffsfile a further amended statement of claim in conformitywiththe requirements of the said rules for actions claiming damages for defamation within six weeks of the date of this order.List for directions before the Common Law Case Management Registrar on 11 October 2024 at 9 am.Grant liberty to the defendant to apply on short notice to theCourt and the plaintiffs in the event of non-compliance with order (2).Dismiss the defendant’s application for summary dismissal.The costs of the parties,in the case of the plaintiffsonlyto the extent to which they may belegallyrecoverable, are costs in the cause.If either party seeks a variation of this costs order, they are to lodge written submissions not exceeding 3 pages in length together with any necessary affidavit with my chambers within 14 days oftodaysdate. The opposing party may have a period of a further 14 days to respond bylodging written submissions with my chambers not exceeding 3 pages in length.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The diaries, however, purport to record $20 contributions to the Lotto syndicate on a number ofThursdaysthatdo not coincide with pension payments.

This is anomalous for the reasons just explained. However, these entries suggest a further anomaly.

He was in no doubt about the matter and in fact by that date had already spoken to NSW Lotteries about the win on two separate occasions."}, {"p_num": 52, "text": "In fact, Mr Way suggested that diary entries also recorded payments of $20 for Lotto on each of 26 and 31 August. I do not accept that the 31 August entry records a $20 payment. Rather, it records that on that day, Mr Bowling told him about the win and that he would be getting $200,000. The 26 August entry is more equivocal. It says“MB 20”. If thisdoes record a lottery payment, it means that in August 2022, being the month in which the syndicate won the major prize, Mr Way contributed cashthreeweeks in a row, which would have been completely out of the ordinaryfor the syndicate.On Mr Way’s case, Mr Bowling took cash from himin this remarkable waythree weeks in a row, without comment, with two of those payments taking place even after the major prize had been won."}, {"p_num": 53, "text": "One possibility is that Mr Bowling was thrown for quite a loop when he found out about the win and was trying to keep things as normal as possible so that no-one found out about it until he had worked out a way forward. There is no doubt that Mr Bowling was shocked and surprised by the win and that he genuinely did want to keep the fact quiet until he knew what to do. But it does seem very strange that he would accept $20 from Mr Way on 18 August 2022(and possibly also 26 August)in order to purchase Lotto ticketsand not say anything to Mr Way about the win."}, {"p_num": 54, "text": "Before reaching any conclusion as to why these various anomaliesmight haveappearedin the diaries and, more particularly, whether I consider the diaries to be a reliable record of Mr Way’s contribution to the purchase of the winning ticket, it is necessary to consider several other matters that were in dispute.The first such matter concerns the evidence of a handwriting specialist called by the defendants to analyse the diaries."}, {"p_num": 55, "text": "The defendants relied on the evidence of MrSteveDubedat, a handwriting expert.

One possibility is that he pickedup a new pen thatwas different to the penhehadused for all previous diary entries and then, on a new page, enteredonlythe highlighted portions (day/date, the reference to“20 LOTTO”, the parentheses, and the entry underneath“SATURDAY 13/8/22”) before that pen ran out.

This is especially so when it is remembered that Mr Way’s own diaries demonstrate thatMr Bowlinghad been honest about the syndicate previously.Mr Way’s case would require meto find that Mr Bowling set out on a course of dishonest dealing long before the win in August 2022 and that he carried on with this deception while otherwise interacting and socialising with Mr Way in his customary manner. This strikes me as a most unlikely thing to have occurred. What was to be gained by systematically cheating his neighbour and friend out of $5 per fortnight for the lottery syndicate ($5 being the difference between the $20 which Mr Way claims to have been paying andthe amounthe should have been paying if he really was still a member of the syndicate)? Not much. On the other hand, Mr Bowling’s case requires me to find that Mr Way dishonestly recreated diary entries, but only once he learned that there was about $1,500,000 to be gained by doing so.

On Saturday, 13 August 2022thatticketwon prizes totalling $5,011,576.70 in draw 4285.It is not in dispute thatthe first defendant purchased the winning ticketon behalf of a syndicate consisting of, at least, him and the second defendant.It is also not in dispute that the plaintiffwasa member of that syndicate formore than ayearcommencing on about17 April 2019. The principal issue in dispute is whether he was still a member of the syndicateon5 August 2022 when the first defendant purchased the winning ticket.Uncontroversial factsThe parties were at all relevant times residents ofNSW social housing apartments in Elderslie, NSW. There are 20 apartments in the housing complex, which are mostly single occupancy. There was a total of about 24 residents at the relevant times.The plaintiff is Mr Allan David Way, although he was known to theother residents, including thedefendants,as Rod Squires.Mr Way took up residence in the apartments in 2018.The first defendant is Mr Mark Peter Bowling, who is 76 years of age. The second defendant is Ms Moya Posar, who is 89 years of age. They had bothbeen livingat the Elderslie apartments for several years prior to 2018.At some point, Mr Bowling became a carer for another resident of the complex, Mary. He had previously resided in his own apartment but when Mary’s health deteriorated, he moved into her apartment. At the times relevant to this dispute, each of the parties lived in their own apartment in the Elderslie complex.The parties were all unemployed. They each received social security benefits of some kind, on which they were almost totally dependent. None of them had other financial means to speak of.For some years prior to 2018, Mr Bowling, Ms Posar and Mary participated in a lottery syndicate which was managed by Mr Bowling. Each fortnight,they contributed to the purchase of one or more tickets in various NSW Lotteries. Mr Bowling would collect cash from each of Ms Posar and Mary and, together with his own contribution, purchase the tickets at a local newsagency.Mary died in February 2018.In the period immediately before she died, Mr Bowling would purchasea System 8 ticket in the Tuesday Oz Lotto draw and the Saturday Lotto draw,totalling about $60.Ms Posar and Mary wouldeachcontribute $20. In fact, the total cost was slightly more than $60, but Mr Bowling paid this difference himself. After Mary died,Mr Bowling and Ms Posar continued to purchase tickets as they had previously done, but they now contributed $30 each.On 17 April 2019, Mr Bowling invited Mr Way to join the syndicate. The evidence about what was saidon this occasion wasdisputed and I will deal with it in due course. However, itwasnotin dispute that from mid-April 2019 until at least September 2021, Mr Waywas a member ofthe syndicate.To begin with, he paid $20 to Mr Bowling each fortnight, usually but not always when he received his pension payment.Mr Bowling was a registered player and held a NSWLotteries card. All of his ticket purchases and winnings over the relevant period were registered and summaries were in evidence. He had“favourite”numbers registered to his card which he played each time he bought tickets. Those favourite numbers were 1, 4, 15, 19, 20, 29, 35 and 38. The numbers did not change between 2017 and August 2022.In July 2020, the syndicate stopped playing Oz Lotto becausethere were some changes in the way that game was drawn. Instead, Mr Bowling beganpurchasing tickets for the mid-week Lotto and the Saturday Lotto, which came to a total of $74.20 per fortnight, to which Ms Posar and Mr Way each contributed $25.By October 2020, the cost of thesyndicate’s Saturday Lotto ticket had increased to $46.30 per fortnight, bringing the total fortnightly cost to $80.30. From mid-November 2020, Mr Bowlingthereforestopped buying tickets in the mid-week Lotto and now onlypurchasedtickets for the Saturday Lotto. Mr Bowling says that from mid-November 2020, Ms Posar and Mr Way each contributed $15 per fortnight towards these tickets. Mr Way says that he simply contributed the amounts which Mr Bowling indicated from time to time, which he says continued to be $20. In other words, Mr Way says that MrBowlingnever told him that thetruecost of syndicate tickets had dropped to $15 each. I will deal withthisissue in due course.The syndicate had minor wins from time to time. When this occurred, Mr Bowling would use thewinningsto purchase tickets on behalf of the syndicate, which meant that they did not need to contribute cash for some period, sometimes several weeks. Records produced by NSW Lotteries show that, following minor wins, Mr Bowling would purchase the same kinds of tickets for the same weekly draws but that he would do so for more weeks at a time. In other words, he used the minor wins to fund additional fortnights of syndicate lottery ticketpurchases.There is however a dispute as to whether Mr Bowling always informed Ms Posar and Mr Way whenthere were minor wins. An aspect of Mr Way’s case is that Mr Bowling did not always do so.It is not clear exactly how Mr Bowling found out about the win, but it must have been no later than 15 August. On that day,Mr Bowling spoke with a representative of NSW Lotteries and they had a discussion about the fact that he held a winning ticket and was entitled to over $5,000,000.The parties were generally in dispute about what happened next. I will set their competing evidence out in due course. For the moment, it is sufficient to note that Mr Way learned about the lottery win in late August, probably31August,when Mr Bowling told him about it.Mr Bowling did not however tell him exactly how much had been won. He did however tell him, on any view, that Mr Waywould be receiving $200,000.The defendants’case is that they paid $200,000 to Mr Way as a gift in recognition of the fact that he had been in the syndicate at an earlier point. Mr Way’s case is that Mr Bowlingknew Mr Way was still a member of the syndicate but that hewas beingdeceptiveabout the winnings.In any event,Mr Way went to a local credit union and opened an account. On7 October 2022, the sum of $200,000 was deposited into that account by Mr Bowling, who transferred funds from the winnings which had been paid into his own account at the same credit unionon 5 October.In all, the following funds transfers took place:On5 October 2022,NSW Lotteries paid$5,011,576.70 to Mr Bowling.On7 October 2022, Mr Bowling paid:$400,000 toa relative ofMs Posar.$200,000 to Mr Way.On13 October 2022,Mr Bowling paid a total of $2,200,000 to various of his relatives.On24 October 2022, Mr Bowling paid a further $2,200,000 to a relative.It appears from this that only $400,000wasappliedfor the benefit of Ms Posar. Nonetheless, it is the defendants’case that they were each entitled to half the winnings. There was no evidence as to any arrangement between thedefendants but I infer from some other evidence to which I will refer in due course that there wasanattempt to handle the winnings in such a way as to protect one or both of their social security entitlements.Both Mr Bowling and Ms Posar accept, however, that a consequence of them succeeding in this case will be that Ms Posar will be found to have been equally entitled to the winnings.In November 2022, Mr Way learnedfrom another resident in the Elderslie apartmentsthat the winnings were vastly more than what he previously understood.Very shortly thereafter, there was a significant altercation between him and Mr Bowling that culminated in Mr Bowling calling the police.Mr Bowling and Ms Posar moved away from the Elderslie apartments quite abruptlyshortly after that altercation.Mr Way commenced these proceedings by summons filed in Court before the duty judge on24 January 2023, on which occasion he obtained orders for the defendants to provide information as to the winnings.In due course,the defendants causeda sum of $1,500,000to bepaid into court and the disputecontinued on pleadings.The dispute in broad outlineMr Way’s case is that he continued to be a member of the syndicate right up until August2022 when the winning ticket was purchased. He claims that he paid whatever sum Mr Bowling requested from time to time.Mr Way relies heavily on daily diaries which he kept during the whole of the relevant period. Those diaries recordnumerousmatters relevant to the dispute. They record the date he was asked to join the syndicate, the date of some minor wins, and the date on which contributions changed to $25 per fortnight. They also record contributions of $20 per fortnight for the whole of the period fromJuly 2021 until August 2022.The defendants, on the other hand,say that Mr Way stopped contributing to the lottery syndicate after a particular incident involving a friend of Mr Way’s who was referred to by all parties as“young Barry”.He was called young Barry because there was another Barry in their orbitwho, unlike young Barry, was a resident of the Elderslie housing complex.The defendants’recollection, taken up in their pleading, was that this argument had occurred in early 2022 and that Mr Way had not been a member of the syndicate since that time. Mr Way’s diaries, however, pinpointed that argument to the night of Saturday, 25 September 2021.The defendantscontendthat the numerous entries in Mr Way’s diaries between July 2021 and August 2022 purporting to record payments of $20 for“Lotto”wereinserted into the diaries at a later point in time and were not made contemporaneously. Theypoint out a number of anomalies in those entries, each of which I will explain and deal with in due course.In terms of legal principle, the plaintiff’s case isfourfold:First, he contends that there was a contract between the parties and that the defendants are liable for damages for breach.He also disputes that any contract among syndicate members was conditional upon continuing to make contributions to tickets.Secondly, he contends that the first defendant was a trustee and is liable to account to him for trust funds.Thirdly, he contends that a“common intention constructive trust”arosein respect ofthe winning ticket.Finally, he contends(albeit only faintly)that the parties had formed a partnership and that the defendants are liable to account to him for his partnership share.The disputed factsThe fact that the syndicate won a prize in excess of $5,000,000was a matter of life changing significance for all involved. Whether or not Mr Way paid–and Mr Bowling received–the sum of $20 each fortnight through to August 2022 is a matter about which one might expect these witnesses would have very good recall. The critical events in dispute occurred in 2021 and 2022 and these proceedings were commenced very shortly thereafter. This is not a case where the passage of time might have caused memories to become blurred about matters that were not particularly significant to thepartiesat the time.The accounts which the parties have given as to their dealings are, however, diametrically opposed. The critical differences are between the evidence of Mr Way, on the one hand, and Mr Bowling, on the other. Ms Posar generally gave evidence in support of Mr Bowling, but because it was always Mr Bowling who collected cash and purchased tickets, it is his evidence that requires the closer scrutiny. It is inevitable that the resolution of these proceedings will involve a finding that one or other partyhas given a highly unreliable account of their dealings.The centrally important issue concerns the reliability of Mr Way’s diaries. That is not to say that Mr Way cannot succeed even if I find his diaries to be unreliable. But in circumstances where he puts forward a contemporaneous, handwritten diary showingregularpaymentsto Mr Bowling of $20 for Lottoin the period leading up to thepurchaseofthe winning ticket, mygeneralassessment of the reliability of his evidence is closely bound up with my assessment of the reliability of the diary.The relationship between Mr Way and Mr Bowling generallyMr Way, Ms Posar and Mr Bowling had a relationship that involved a lot of interactions from week to week. They lived in very close proximity and had lots to do with one another. They cooked meals which they shared. Mr Way had a barbeque on which he would prepare a meal and take some to theothers. Mr Bowling would dolikewise with roast dinners. Mr Way was unemployed but was resourceful, especially with mechanical matters. He would fix people’s cars and bikes. He would also buy cars and bikes, do them up and sell them.Mr Way and Mr Bowling would frequently drink and socialize together. However, their relationship had both social and transactional aspects. Mr Way’s diaries contain numerous references to“6 packs”in connection with Mr Bowling. Mr Way explained that a reference in his diaries to“MB 6 pack”(or something similar) could mean he drankasix-pack of beer with Mr Bowling, or that Mr Bowling gave him a six-pack, or that he gave Mr Bowling a six-pack in return for an earlier transaction. In any event, Mr Way would make a note to record the transaction.Mr Wayalso borrowed money from him from time to time. Mr Bowling often had cash froma“punters’club”which he would lend to Mr Way, for example to buy beer.Mr Way would generally make a note in his diary when he borrowed from,or repaid money (or beer) to,Mr Bowling.Mr Way’s diariesAs the foregoing paragraph shows, I do accept that Mr Way was someone who generally kept a diary. It was not suggested to Mr Way in cross-examination that he did not do so. His diaries were relied on by both sides to date matters relevant to the dispute, such as when he joined the syndicate and when the altercation with young Barry occurred.Mr Way explained that hewould make entries in his diaries on most days, usually early in the morning when his mind was clear.The diaries contain all manner of detail about Mr Way’s life, such as who he visited, who visited him, when and where he went to the shops, whether he had cooked a barbecue, what car or bike he was working on, names and phone numbers. They contain observations about current events (the death of the Queen, for example) as well as the occasional jotting or doodle.Overall, they are quite methodical. They are contained in exercise books (or similar), not commercially printed diaries. Mr Way would make an entry for almost everyday by writing the day and date and then a few lines recording what he did that day. Some days simply said“HOME”. Others containedmuchmore detail.For example, the page containing the entry for 17 April 2019, which is the day he first joined the lottery syndicate, appeared as follows:During the period commencing 17 April 2019 until8July 2021, there are only a few entries referring to the Lotto.There is an entry for 2 June 2019 that reads:“LOTTO 4 WEEKS”A“customer win history report”produced by NSW Lotteries shows thatthe syndicate won $135.20 on 25 May 2019, which at that time was enough to cover two fortnights of ticket purchases, plus a little more. MrBowling must have told Mr Way about the minor win and that he was covered for four weeks, which would explain this diary entry.A“customer ticket history report”produced by NSW Lotteries shows that Mr Bowling purchased twice the number of tickets as usual on 31 May 2019. He purchased tickets in four Oz Lotto draws and seven Saturday Lotto draws, at a total cost of $42 and $79.60 respectively. At this stage, he was normally purchasing tickets in two Oz Lotto draws and three Saturday Lotto draws, at a total cost of $21 and $39.80 per ticket respectively.This evidence tends to confirm the evidence of both parties in some important respects. For Mr Way, it corroborates his evidence that he was keeping contemporaneous records and that they included records as to the lottery syndicate. For MrBowling, it corroborates his evidence that he was purchasing tickets when and on the basis he said he was, including that he would use the proceeds of minor wins to purchase further tickets on behalf of the syndicate.Not all such minor wins are mentioned in Mr Way’s diary during the period when Mr Way was, on any view, a member of the syndicate. However, the NSW Lotteries reports which I have mentioned show that Mr Bowling did purchase additional tickets following minor wins and that the value of those additional tickets broadly reflected the amounts of those minor wins, regardless of whether Mr Way recorded the fact or not.I earlier referred to the fact that Mr Bowling stopped purchasing Oz Lotto tickets and instead started purchasing mid-week Lotto tickets in July 2020. This change meant that the total ticket cost (at least initially) was $74.20 per fortnight, to which Ms Posar and Mr Way each contributed $25. These circumstances are borne out by the NSW Lotteries reports. They are also recorded in Mr Way’s diary. An entry for13 July 2020 includes:“MARK BPAID 25 LOTTO”Again, this evidence is corroborative of both witnesses. It tends to support the proposition that Mr Way’s diaries were kept contemporaneously. It also tends to support Mr Bowling’s evidence that he kept members of the syndicate informed as to what they needed to contribute and that he generally collected an appropriate amount to cover the cost of tickets.Mr Way’s diary does not however make mention of the change in ticket price that occurred after October 2020 when Mr Bowling started purchasing only Saturday Lotto tickets at a cost of $46.30 each fortnight. In fact, Mr Way’s diaries do not at any stage mention a payment of $15 to Mr Bowling for Lotto tickets, even though Mr Bowling only purchased Saturday Lotto tickets at a cost of $46.30fora longperiodleading up to August 2022.The diaries in evidence covered the whole period from 17 April 2019, when Mr Way joined the syndicate, through to the end of 2022. Between 17 April 2019 and 18 August 2022, which is shortly before Mr Way found out that the syndicate had won, there is a total of 38 mentions of“Lotto”(or similar), two ofwhich record minor wins as just described. Of those 36 mentionsof payments, however, 30 appear at roughly fortnightly intervals commencing on8July2021.Those 30 entriesall record that Mr Way paid the sum of $20 to Mr Bowling. During that same period, there is no mention of any minor wins, even though Mr Bowling said–and the NSW Lotteries documents confirm–that there were severalminorwins during this period.For example, on 18 December 2021 the syndicate won $133.10, which was paid to Mr Bowling on 23 December. Also on 23 December, Mr Bowling purchased a ticket for Saturday Lotto draws 4219 to 4229 for $138.90, which covered the syndicate for that game for three fortnights, remembering that each fortnight’s ticket usually cost $46.30.He did not subsequently purchase more tickets until 4 February 2022.However, Mr Way’s diary records that he paid $20 to Mr Bowling for“Lotto”on 23 December 2021, 6 January 2022, 20 January 2022 (mistakenly recorded as“20/11/22”, but I read nothing into this) and 3 February 2022.This evidence is impossible to reconcile. Either Mr Way paid Mr Bowling $60 for lottery tickets during a period in which Mr Bowling neither needed nor used cash from syndicate members to purchase tickets (which would imply dishonesty by Mr Bowling, both at the time of the events as well as in giving evidence in these proceedings), or the diary entries are not a true record of Mr Way’s contributions (which implies dishonesty by Mr Way).Theseparticular anomaliesappear on every occasionthe syndicate had a minor winsubsequent to July 2021. According to Mr Way, he continued to pay $20 to Mr Bowling roughly fortnightly, despite the ticket cost only being $46.30 and despite the fact that Mr Bowlingclearlyused the proceeds of minor wins to fund tickets when he could.As mentioned, Mr Bowling would purchase tickets fortnightly. The NSW Lotteriescustomer tickethistory report demonstratesthat he did so very regularly. He also says that the syndicate members–he, Ms Posar and MrWay when he was in the syndicate–would contribute cash on the day they received their pension cheques, typically a Thursday. The diaries, however, purport to record $20 contributions to the Lotto syndicate on a number ofThursdaysthatdo not coincide with pension payments. To be sure, many entries do show payments on the day Mr Way received his pension, but at times the entries become out of sync with the pension cyclefor weeks (or, rather, fortnights) at a time.Furthermore, Mr Way’s diary records that he paid Mr Bowling $20 for Lotto on 11 August 2022and18 August 2022. This is anomalous for the reasons just explained. However, these entries suggest a further anomaly. That is because by 18 August 2022, Mr Bowling knew he already held the winning ticket from the 13 August draw. He was in no doubt about the matter and in fact by that date had already spoken to NSW Lotteries about the win on two separate occasions.In fact, Mr Way suggested that diary entries also recorded payments of $20 for Lotto on each of 26 and 31 August. I do not accept that the 31 August entry records a $20 payment. Rather, it records that on that day, Mr Bowling told him about the win and that he would be getting $200,000. The 26 August entry is more equivocal. It says“MB 20”. If thisdoes record a lottery payment, it means that in August 2022, being the month in which the syndicate won the major prize, Mr Way contributed cashthreeweeks in a row, which would have been completely out of the ordinaryfor the syndicate.On Mr Way’s case, Mr Bowling took cash from himin this remarkable waythree weeks in a row, without comment, with two of those payments taking place even after the major prize had been won.One possibility is that Mr Bowling was thrown for quite a loop when he found out about the win and was trying to keep things as normal as possible so that no-one found out about it until he had worked out a way forward. There is no doubt that Mr Bowling was shocked and surprised by the win and that he genuinely did want to keep the fact quiet until he knew what to do. But it does seem very strange that he would accept $20 from Mr Way on 18 August 2022(and possibly also 26 August)in order to purchase Lotto ticketsand not say anything to Mr Way about the win.Before reaching any conclusion as to why these various anomaliesmight haveappearedin the diaries and, more particularly, whether I consider the diaries to be a reliable record of Mr Way’s contribution to the purchase of the winning ticket, it is necessary to consider several other matters that were in dispute.The first such matter concerns the evidence of a handwriting specialist called by the defendants to analyse the diaries.The handwriting evidenceThe defendants relied on the evidence of MrSteveDubedat, a handwriting expert. Mr Dubedat was well qualified to express an opinion about technical aspects concerning handwriting. Mr Dubedat was provided with the original diaries for the relevant period andthefollowing direction:“Mr Way claims to have made cash payments to Mark Bowling of approximately $20 each fortnight from about 2019 as a contribution to the cost of Lotto tickets to be purchased by Mr Bowling on behalf of Mr Bowling, Ms Posar and Mr Way. Mr Bowling and Ms Posar accept that payments for Lotto purchases were made by Mr Way until about late 2021 (although they say that from about October 2020 the amount of the payment was $15, not $20). They dispute that Mr Way made payments to Mr Bowling for Lotto tickets in 2022 and deny that Mr Way contributed to the purchase of the winning Lotto draw.Mr Way has served an affidavit in the proceedings which includes the following statements:‘Since before the time I moved into the housing, I have always kept journals regarding my day to day dealings, payments and interactions with people. I do this because I like to have a record to refer to and to be able to determine what I did on a particular day.’and‘Each time I made a payment to the First defendant in relation to the Club, I would usually record it in a journal. I labelled the transactions “Lotto MB or Paid MB” or similar as the First defendant’s initials are MB.’We request that you conduct whatever examinations you consider necessary to confirm whether journal entries referring to payments to Mr Bowling for Lotto were contemporaneous with other entries apparently made on that date or whether in your opinion they were made at a different time. Please alsoreport your opinion on any matters emerging from your examination which casts light on the veracity or otherwise of the journals and the entries which purport to or appear to relate to payments to ‘MB’ or ‘Mark’.Please give additional attention to:1. The entry on 17 April 20192. Entries in late 2021 and in 20223. Entries in July and August 2022.”Mr Dubedat provided a report dated21 July 2023. Mr Dubedat explained his methodology, which involved a combination of microscopic examination, infrared examination using a video spectral comparator, andexamination withelectrostatic detection device. He also examined the diaries for ink transference, which can be used to determine the sequencing of ink strokes and the relative dating of ink entries.He also explained the differences that can be apparent from handwritten documents written all at one time (so-called synchronous writing) and those handwritten documents written over a course of time (so-called asynchronous writing).However,as he explained,the identification of those differences and the significance to be attributed to them requires subjective judgment on the part of the examiner.Mr Dubedat’s conclusions were interesting but, ultimately, not of great assistance in resolving the particular issues in dispute. That is not a criticism of Mr Dubedat. It is just that he was not able to reach particularly firm conclusions based on the material.I note that almost none of the somewhat tentative conclusions reached by Mr Dubedat were put to Mr Way in cross-examination.So, for example, Mr Dubedat’s final remarks were in these terms:“Based upon my experience in examining diaries with a view to determining whether entries are contemporaneous or not, it is unusual to see such a high degree of uniformity in handwritten entries which have purportedly been written over an extended period of time. Although I am unable to determine when each handwritten entry was made, the uniformity of numerous entries in writing quality, ink (Book “2”), spacing, arrangement, alignment, day/datesynchronisation notes (Book “1”), ink transference (Book “2”) combined with numerous dating errors all support the proposition that a large number of entries in each book/diary are not contemporaneous. Themajorityof the entries in Book “0” appear to have been written in groups, and show more variability in the entries compared to the other books. The majority of the entries in Books “1” and “2” show more uniformity throughout. If one assumes that the records in each book have not beenwrittencontemporaneously; then they may have been written in groups (eg one week or more), transcribed from another record, or are fabrications. As such, I would recommend anyone who seeks to rely on theentriesas beingcontemporaneous records to do so with caution.”However, it was not suggested to Mr Way that any of the diarieswereprepared“synchronously.”Rather, what was put to Mr Way was that those entries between July 2021 and August 2022 which purport to record paymentsof $20 to Mr Bowling for Lotto were inserted later. That, however, is not a proposition that findsspecificsupport in Mr Dubedat’s report. His point was that the diaries as a whole might all have been written at once, or in groups. He did not find evidence to conclude that thespecificentries challenged by the defendants were inserted later.One specific matter identified by Mr Dubedat was thatanentry recordinga payment by Mr Way on 11 August 2022, two days before the win,was written in a different ink from other entries on that page. The page in question appeared as follows:Infrared examination of this page revealed that a number of entries were made with a different ink from the other entries. Mr Dubedat highlighted those parts of the page written in different ink, as follows:The body of his report drew particular attention to the fact that the day and date at the top of the page, as well as the words“20 LOTTO”and the parentheses, were written in a different ink.Counsel for Mr Way drew his attention to two additional matters on this page. The first was that the words at the bottom of the page were also written in that different ink. This is a matter to which the body ofMr Dubedat’sreport did not refer.It was also pointed out thatthe scrawl at the top of the pagecouldsuggestthat Mr Way wasusinga pen that was running out of inkand that this was a matter which Mr Dubedat should have noticed and commented upon. Mr Dubedat accepted both of these criticisms of his report and agreed that it was reasonable to conclude that the pen was running out of ink.At the same time, however, the balance of the entries on that page appeared to Mr Dubedat to be written in the same ink as the rest of the diaries. He also pointed out that the scrawl at the top of the page was written in the same ink as the word“LOTTO”and the other highlighted entries.It is difficult to know what to conclude about these entries on the basis of Mr Dubedat’s report. His evidence could support the defendants’case that this“Lotto”entry, at least, was not written at the same time as the rest of the diaryas it was written in different ink,possiblywith a pen that ran out. On the other hand, none of the other disputed“Lotto”entrieswerewritten in that different ink.His evidence might also support the plaintiff’s case, because the“Lotto”entry on this page is only written in a different ink because the pen used to write it stopped working. However, that is a more problematic proposition because it is a theory that involves Mr Waydoing one of two rather odd things. One possibility is that he pickedup a new pen thatwas different to the penhehadused for all previous diary entries and then, on a new page, enteredonlythe highlighted portions (day/date, the reference to“20 LOTTO”, the parentheses, and the entry underneath“SATURDAY 13/8/22”) before that pen ran out. He must then, on that theory, have picked up the pen he had used for all previous (and all subsequent) pages to complete the rest of the page, including the word“PACK”inside the parentheses he had just written. Another possibility is that he used the pen he had been using previously, wrote everything except the highlighted portions, and then picked up a new pen to complete the pagebut reverted to the old pen for all subsequent diary entrieswhen that new pen ran out.In the end, I am unable to determine exactlyhow this page in the diary came aboutbased on Mr Dubedat’s evidence. The empty pen hypothesis does not, to my mind, sit terribly comfortably with Mr Way’s case, but this is a matter on which I am not prepared to placesignificantweight in the absence of any firm conclusion from the handwriting expert.Other disputed factual mattersIt is necessaryto notea number of other disputed factual matters before attempting to resolve the question of the reliability of the diaries and the parties’evidence generally.For reasons I will explain, I generally favour Mr Bowling’s accounts of these incidents over Mr Way’s, except to the limited extent indicated below. Nonetheless it is appropriate to note the parties’divergent accounts of how they dealt with one another at relevant times.On what terms did Mr Way join the syndicate?Mr Way gave evidence that Mr Bowling invited him to become a member of the syndicatein 2019. As mentioned, his diary shows that this occurred on 17 April of that year.Mr Way recalls that Mr Bowling said:“Would you like to join the lottery club I have going with Moya [Ms Posar]? Our old neighbour Mary used to be a member of the club, but now that she is gone there is a free spot.”He advised that he had a registered account and that he would“manage finance and administration”on behalf of the syndicate.Mr Bowling then said:“I will let you know how much money to give me and when to give it to me. We will split any winnings equally between the three of us.”Mr Way agreed. Mr Bowling then said:“What two numbers doyou want to play? I will play them every week, so let me know when or if you want to change them.”Mr Way said:“I want numbers 1 and 15.”He said, and I accept, that the numbers 1 and 15 had special significance to him.Mr Bowling’s account was somewhat different. He denies that he referred to any“lottery club”.He denies that he offered Mr Way an opportunity to nominate his own numbers.He also denied referring to Mary, their recently deceased old neighbour. He claims to have said:“Would you like to come in our lotto with us? With Moya and I? We’re in a system 8 Oz Lotto on a Tuesday night and the Saturday night Lotto and these are our numbers. We keep our numbers. It will cost you $20 a fortnight and if we win anything we split it. Moya gives me her money on pension day so you can do the same thing. You can please yourself if you want to come in, but we keep these numbers. We’ve been playing them for a long time.”Mr Bowling says that Mr Way agreed. Mr Bowling then claims to have written the numbers down on a piece of paper and given them toMr Way. The numbers he wrote down were the same numbers as included on the winning ticket and included the numbers 1 and 15.Despite their disagreement as to this issue, which permeated the parties’evidence, nothing turns on whether Mr Bowling used the word“club”or“syndicate”, nor on whether Mr Way was“invited”to nominate numbers.On any view, Mr Bowling was inviting Mr Way to join a lottery syndicate of the kind considered by the High Court inVan Rassel v Kroon(1953) 87 CLR 298; [1953] HCA 3whether he described it as a club or not. Nonetheless, I find that Mr Bowling did say the word“club”as Mr Way contends. I note that in cross-examinationMr Bowlinghimself used the expression“club”on several occasions to describe their arrangement. He also ran what he called a“punters’club”for residents of the Elderslie housing complex.So far as the numbers were concerned, the evidence shows that the numbers on the winning ticket were the very same numbers which the syndicate had been playing since at least 2017, long before Mr Way joined.For reasons I explain below, I do not accept that Mr Bowling gave Mr Way an opportunity to nominate his own numbers for the syndicate.The altercation about young BarryThe fact of analtercation involving young Barrywas not in dispute.On MrBowling’srecollection,the incident occurred whenyoung Barrywasstaying withMr Way in late January or early February 2022. As mentioned, the incident in fact occurred in September 2021. Mr Bowling recalls that young Barry and Mr Way were drinking one night whenyoung Barry asked Mr Bowling and Ms Posar to come over for a visit. The apartments were very close together, so it was not far to go. There were COVID-related social distancing restrictions in place at the time and so Mr Bowling and Ms Posar were both wearing masks. Ms Posar is particularly elderly and Mr Bowling was worried about her catching COVID.Mr Way and young Barry were not wearing masks and, as far as Mr Bowling was aware, neither had received a COVID vaccination. He and Ms Posar were uncomfortable about the visit and so they returned home to have dinner.Later that night,Mr Bowling heard young Barry yelling expletives about him near his back door.Next morning, Mr Bowling saw Mr Way and young Barry. He challenged them and said:“What’s he doing back here? We don’t want him back here causing trouble. There’s elderly people here.”As Mr Bowling recalls, Mr Way replied by being intimidating and abusive towards him. In one of his affidavits, Mr Bowling said that Mr Way also said:“You can’t pick your own numbers anyway. They’re dead people’s numbers.”According to Mr Bowling, it was immediately after this altercation that Mr Way stopped contributing to the Lotto syndicate. He says that from this time onwards, he continued to buy a ticket for the Saturday Lotto but that only he and Ms Posar contributed the sum of $23 each.One issue in dispute iswhether Mr Way said anything during this altercation about the Lotto syndicate. He denied thathedid so. He also denied that he had been abusive and suggested that it was Mr Bowling who had instigated the argument. He recalls saying“piss off inside and I’ll deal with it. Don’t tell me who I can and can’t see.”I note that Mr Way’s diary refers to this incident in the following terms:“SATURDAY 25/9/21MARK – MOYA ARG. ABOUT BAS GOING OFF (BAN)”“Bas”was a reference to young Barry. There is nothing in the diary about the Lotto.In cross-examination, Mr Bowling seemed to accept that Mr Way had not in fact said anything about thelottery during the altercation.I am in the end unable to draw any particular conclusion from the way the parties each recounted this episode. The parties all recalled the episode in much the same way, save as to where blame lay. Given Mr Bowling’s acceptance in cross-examination that Mr Way did not in fact say anything about thelotteryon that particular day, I find that he did not do so.However, Mr Bowling did not accept that it was never said.In fact, he maintained that it was.I notealsothat Ms Posarrecalls Mr Way saying something to like effect at a later point.The events of August 2022Mr Bowling made two calls to NSW Lotteries in August2022following the win.The first call was made on 15 August. It is relevant to notethe following interaction where Mr Bowling states that he has won the lotto:“Operator:‘Good afternoon. You're speaking with Daniel. How can I help?Mr Bowling:‘Oh, yeah, mate. Yes. I believe I've won Saturday night Lotto.’”The second call was made on 16 August. In that call, heat one pointmentioned that he had won with“another lady”:“Mr Bowling:‘Oh, OK, love. Alright. Yeah, yep. Well what it is anyway, it's a lot of money. It's it's five. It's ah 5 million dollars alright? And and what? I'm just wait, I just want to ask a question before you ask anything else.Operator:‘Uh huh.’Mr Bowling:‘Because I'm with another lady, right? My neighbour. Right? So we've won two and a half million dollars each, OK? And when and when I do this claim form and fill it out and give my bank details right? And and all the money's gonna go into my bank account. But what I want to know is, can I get her, her bank details and mine so she can have half hers and half mine without it all going into my bank account?’”According to Mr Way,inlateAugust 2022 Mr Bowling approached him in the driveway at Elderslie and said:“Moya and I were going to come over and tell you, but I’ll tell you now. I’ll be giving you money soon, we had a win in Lotto. We won $5 million with 4 other winners so the money will be split five ways. All up we won about $1 million. You’ll be getting a hundred to a couple of hundred thousand out of it.”Mr Way’s diary shows that this was on 31 August.Mr Way expressed his surprise and thanks. Mr Bowling then said:“Don’t tell anyone that we have won. I’ve held off claiming it because I don’t want us to lose our benefits. I rangLotto and told them not to send the ladies around with the champagne so no one would find out. If people find out that we’ve won, we will lose our pension and our houses.”There was then a discussionabout Mr Way opening a bank account at the Macarthur Credit Union. Mr Way did go to the credit union to open an account, as discussed.Mr Bowling’s account is somewhat different. He claims to have said:“I’ve got something to tell you. Me and Moya won the lotto and we’ve decided to give you $200,000 as a gift to help you out.”Hesaysthat he and Ms Posar felt sorry forMr Way, which is why they decided to give him $200,000 from their winnings.It is relevant to note that on neither Mr Way’s account nor on Mr Bowling’s account was Mr Way told how much Mr Bowling had actually won.Mr Bowling denies that he said anything about pensions. He claims to have said:“I don’t want you to tell anyone about the lotto yet. I’ve got things to thinkabout. I’ve got the cat to worry about and I’ve got Moya to worry about. Just keep it quiet for a while.”He also said:“Moya and I are in no hurry to claim our prize.”He says that he was worried about his ageing cat and did not want to move until his cat had passed away.The events of September 2022On 1 September 2022, Mr Way attended the Macarthur Credit Union and opened an account. He gave his account details to Mr Bowling. However, weeks went by and the $200,000 did not come through to his account. He began to question Mr Bowling about the win. He recalls questioning him in September in these terms:“When are you giving me the money? Can you show me the winning ticket, I want to see the exact amount that we won.”According to Mr Way, Mr Bowling turned hostile and abusive. He said:“you’re lucky you’re getting anything.”According to Mr Way, there were four or five such exchanges with Mr Bowling during September 2022. On one occasion, Mr Bowling broke down in tears and said:“I wish I never won this money.”Mr Bowling’s recollection again differs, although not significantly.He did not dispute that Mr Way was pressuring him in September in relation to the money. He does however dispute that Mr Way ever asked to see the ticket.It is also relevant to note that Mr Bowlinghad a further discussion with NSW Lotteries on 9 September in which he said:“Andthe thing is, I've, I've got an 18 year old pussycat here. That's been here longer than me and I inherited and I've moved into this house now and I can't go anywhere at the moment. I won't. The cat’s more important to me than the money. I think about animals first and I won't leave. But my main problem is there's other people that I've got to give money to out of this prize and I want to get them out of the road and then I can just-This, this is, you know, you know, I'm that depressed about things. And I'm and I'm getting people having the shot at me and, ‘Ah don't worry about the bloody cat.’ Well to me animals are better than people.”October 2022At the same time, the parties continued tointeract andsocialisein their usual way. They all had dinner together in Mr Bowling’s apartment in October, at which time Mr Way claims to have again pressed them to show him the winning ticket. According to Mr Way, Mr Bowling indicated to Ms Posar that she should not say anything.Mr Bowling eventually received the winnings into his account. I have already set out the subsequent payments he made, including to Mr Way.Also in October2022, Mr Way claims that he wanted to tell neighbour Barry about the win, but that Mr Bowling said:“Remember not to tell anyone about the Lotto win, we don’t want the Housing Commission Officer to find out and we lose our houses.”Mr Bowling disputes this, but not much turns on it. It is part of Mr Bowling’s own case that he wanted to keep the matter quiet in part because of a concern about having to move out of the apartments.I do accept that Mr Bowling said not to tell anyone about the win, because that is consistent with his desire to keep it quiet, but I do not accept that Mr Way was at this pointpressing to see the ticket.My reason for not accepting this evidence is that, as I will explain in due course, I generally find Mr Bowling’s evidence to be more reliable than Mr Way’s when it comes to their dealings about the lottery win. I do not accept that Mr Way at this point believed himself to be a member of the syndicate.November 2022Matters came to a head in November 2022, when another resident of the Elderslie apartments, Jennifer,told Mr Way that Ms Posar had won over $2,000,000 in the Lotto.There followed a discussion with Mr Bowling. Again, the content of the discussion is disputed but, again, not much turns on it.Mr Way recalls that it went like this:“In November 2022 or thereabouts I questioned the First defendant again about the Major win. I recall saying:‘Jennifer has told me that Moya won over 2 million dollars. Show me the winning ticket so I can see how much we won. I thought I was getting a third share of $1 million.’The First defendant refused to give me any details about the Major win, ticket number or draw date.I recall the First defendant saying:‘It’s none of your business. You got what you got.’I remember I said:‘It is my business, I’m in the club. I’ve been putting money in for years.’”Mr Bowling denies that these exchanges took place.Learning about the size of the win prompted Mr Way to call NSW Lotteries to see if he could find out more about the prize. A recording of the call was in evidence. It is relevant to note that it included the following:“Operator:‘Yeah? How can I help?’Mr Way:‘It would have been earlier this year and I know the address of the person and his name because I'm part of that syndicate and I'm trying to find out how much exactly was won.’Operator:‘OK, so was the ticket earlier this year?’Mr Way:‘Yeah, beginning about, the beginning of this year sometime. And he, he didn't put his claim form for months and months and months. And then he, he deposited money into my account. But I've since found out that he won a lot more.’”The defendants particularly relied on Mr Way’s suggestion that the win could have been at the beginning of 2022. If in November 2022Mr Waybelieved that the win could have been at the beginning of the year, he would (on their theory of the case)have neededto ensure that his diaries recorded $20 payments to Mr Bowling going back some time. It would be no good simply recording a payment or two in July and August. They point out the regular but anomalous diary entries in fact cover an entire year prior to August 2022. They also point out that if the diaries were, as he now claims, reliable, then he would have seen that he was paying for Lotto tickets right up until 18 August, just before he found out about the win. He would not in those circumstances have been so vague about when the win occurred when he spoke with NSW Lotteries.There is some force in these arguments, but they areultimatelyinconclusive. If by November 2022 Mr Way was deeply distrustful of Mr Bowling,ashe claims, then he would have had no reason to suppose that Mr Bowling was ever telling him the truth about the lottery tickets. In the end, I am not prepared to attach significant weightto what was said by Mr Way in this call.The defendants move out of the Elderslie apartmentsAs already noted, Mr Way received $200,000 from Mr Bowling on 7October 2022. According to Mr Bowling, everything was fine between them right up to Friday,25 November 2022, when Mr Way and another neighbour visited him in his apartment, together with Ms Posar, for a drink. However, by the early hours of Monday, 28 November, things had unravelled. There was an abusive confrontation in which Mr Bowling felt threatened. He left his apartment in fearand called the police. There was a further confrontation later that day in which Mr Way was again abusive. At that point,Mr Bowlingsays that he and Ms Posar left the apartments to avoid Mr Way and have not returned.Mr Bowling gave a detailed account of these events. Mr Way selectively denied only specific aspects of what was said. He did not seem to deny the charge of having been abusive towards Mr Bowling on 28 November 2022, both in the early hours and then later in the afternoon of that day.In the circumstances, I accept Mr Bowling’s account of what occurred, although I am unable to reach a conclusion as to exactly what was said. Relevantly, I find that Mr Way was generally quite abusive towards Mr Bowling and thatthis is the reasonhe and Ms Posarleft.The witnessesAs I have already explained and as the parties accepted, it is not possible to resolve these proceedings without making some fairly serious findings about the reliability of either Mr Bowling’s or Mr Way’s evidence. Each party submitted that I should, at least in part, base my conclusion on my own assessment of the witnesses in giving their evidence. Each party pointed out the shortcomings of the other in that respect.In all, I did not find the oral evidence of either Mr Way or Mr Bowling, or their demeanour in the witness box, to be especially telling. Each was a poor witness in some respects, but neither gave their evidence in such a way as to make me think either of them was generally unreliable. The protagonistswerealllong-termresidents of social housing, who were entirely dependent on social security and who lived from fortnight to fortnight, but whose lives were turned upside down by a Lotto win. They all had difficulties of various kinds in following the questions they were being asked by the cross-examiner, although each appeared to be at least trying to do their best.Mr Way was quite methodical. He was generally a slow and careful witness who was quite short and direct in the way he answered questions. He was notargumentative. He did not always follow the nuances in questions and so often answered questions he had not been asked, but I did not have the impression that he was generally trying to avoid answering questions.Mr Bowling was a very different kind of character. He wasquiteexcitable. Unlike Mr Way, he was positively argumentative, but not in a way that obscured the facts about which he could give evidence. In other words, he did not parry away questions with argument; he tended to answer them, but in a combative and argumentative way. He had the same difficulties as Mr Way in following some of the nuances in questions and, like Mr Way, often answered questions he had not been asked.Ms Posar does not have English as a first language. She is very elderly and did not seem to be in the best of health at the time she gave evidence. She was clearly mistaken about some things.For example, she thought Mr Way was only in the syndicate for“weeks”, not years.On the other hand, she knew that she had limited knowledge of the central issues in dispute and, sensibly, did not generally try to express views about those matters except to the extent she was able to.Despite these difficulties, andalthough not decisive, there areseveralmatters to noteinrelation to the evidence of the witnesses.First, in one of his affidavitsMr Waysaid:“Each time I made a payment to [Mr Bowling] in relation to the Club [ie, the syndicate], I would usually record it in the journal.”I am not able to accept that this is correct. He did not“usually”make a note of his contributions tothe syndicate. On his case, his practice of writing down his contributions only started (if his diaries are to be believed) in about July 2020.There are noregularreferences to the making of lottery contributions,despite it being common ground that he made fortnightly contributions,for over a year prior to July 2020.Secondly,an aspect of the defendants’case is that at about the time Mr Way stopped contributing to the syndicate he said that he did not want to play witha“dead person’s numbers”.Mr Bowling’s recollection is that he said this at the time of the dispute concerning young Barry. Ms Posar’s recollection is that he said it a bit later. On their case, the fact that Mr Way said these words at around the time he stopped contributing is evidence that he intended to drop out of the syndicate.The reference to a“dead person’s numbers”was to the fact that the syndicate was playing numbers chosen, in part, by Mary whohad passedby the time Mr Way joined.It is also, on their case, somewhat corroborative of Mr Bowling’s account of the circumstances in which Mr Way joined the syndicate. Mr Bowling disputes that Mr Way nominated his own numbers at the time he joined the syndicate. Instead, as he points out and as other evidence confirms, the syndicate played exactly the same numbers over the whole of the relevant period, including when it comprised Mr Bowling, Ms Posar and Mary. In other words, the numbers did not change when Mr Way joined.Mr Way denied that he eversaidsuch a thing out loud. On the other hand, he saysin one of his affidavitsthat thethoughtof playing with a“dead person’s numbers”is what prompted him to nominate the numbers 1 and 15.On his case, when he joined the syndicate he nominated his own numbers, being 1 and 15, because he did not want to play with Mary’s numbers.I am not able to accept Mr Way’s evidence about this.By far the most likely explanation for the fact that the syndicate played the same numbers before and after Mr Way joined is that Mr Bowling either did not ask Mr Way about the numbers or, if he did, did not give him an opportunity to select new numbers.Mr Bowling’s evidence is an inherently more likely–and therefore more reliable–account of how Mr Way joined the syndicatewhen compared withMr Way’s evidence.Counsel for Mr Way suggested to Mr Bowlingthat his evidence about this matter was a concoction.He suggested thatMr Bowlinghad simplyread MrWay’s evidence that hethought aboutnot wanting to play with a“dead person’s numbers”but then dishonestlyclaimed it was something Mr Wayhad actuallysaidout loudat the time he left the syndicate.The difficulty with this argument is that it assumes its own premise, namelythatMr Way never said it. The question is: did he? Counsel for Mr Way submitted thatMr Bowling and Ms Posar arebothto be disbelieved when they say that Mr Way said he did not want to play with a“dead person’s numbers”. I am however inclined to believeMr Bowling’sevidence about this matter. First,both Mr Bowling and Ms Posareachhad anindependentrecollectionof Mr Way using these words, albeit at slightly different times.Mr Bowling accepted that it was not saidduringthealtercation, but he did not accept that it wasnotsaidat around that time.Secondly,my consideration of the likelihood of whether Mr Way’s account of how he joined the syndicate is correct (being the matter referred to previously) has already caused me to doubt Mr Way’s account of what occurred on this occasion.This conclusion is relevant in two related ways. First, it bolsters my conclusion that Mr Bowling’s account of how Mr Way joined the syndicate is more reliable than Mr Way’s account. It also inclines me to accept that Mr Bowling’s account of how Mr Way left the syndicate is reliable. It makes more sense that Mr Way would raise a difficulty about playing with a“dead person’s numbers”when leaving the syndicate (which had been playing with those numbers) than when joining it, when he was clearly otherwise willing to play with those same numbers.Mr Way argued that the evidence of what Mr Bowling said in his calls with NSW Lotteries involved an admission by him that the syndicate consisted of more than just him and Ms Posar.I cannot accept that submission. Mr Bowling’s statements to NSW Lotteries line up with his other evidence as to what was happening at relevant times. When he first spoke with them on 14 August, he referred to having wontheLotto himself. Thiswasnatural enough. He held the ticket.It was notsuggested that he had any designs to cut Ms Posar out of the syndicate. I do not read anything into the fact that he did not refer to the syndicate (or anyone else) in this call.When he spoke toNSW Lotteriesthe next day, perhaps with aslightlyclearer head, he referred to the fact that he had to split the winnings with Ms Posar.It was only in the final call, in September, that he spoke about“others”. But by this stage, he had promised $200,000 to Mr Way.I would not conclude on the basis of this that he was making an admission that Mr Way continued to be a member of the syndicate.What he said is consistent with his claim that, by this time, Mr Way was pressuring him for the $200,000.Lastly, Mr Way also pointed out that until shortly prior to the hearing, Mr Bowling’s defence had contained a series of sweeping denials as to matters that now appear never to have been in dispute. It was suggested that I should draw conclusions adverse to Mr Bowling’s credit based on the fact that he had sworn an affidavit verifyingthe defence that containedhis denials of so many matters in circumstances where, as it emerged, he did not really deny them at all.There may be cases where it is appropriate to draw adverse inferences against a witness because of a matter such as this, but this is not such a case.I can accept that Mr Bowling should have been more careful about whether the defence was accurate, but I cannot hold him primarily responsible for the manifest shortcomings in the defence. The document was drafted for him by lawyers, who should have known better. I am not in these circumstances prepared to draw adverse conclusions as to Mr Bowling’s credit.Other evidenceInFox v Percy(2003) 214 CLR 118; [2003] HCA 22 Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ saidat [31]-[32]:“It is true, as McHugh J has pointed out, that for a very long time judges in appellate courts have given as a reason for appellate deference to the decision of a trial judge, the assessment of the appearance of witnesses as they give their testimony that is possible at trial and normally impossible in an appellate court. However, it isequally true that, for almost as long, other judges have cautioned against the dangers of too readily drawing conclusions about truthfulness and reliability solely or mainly from the appearance of witnesses. Thus, in 1924 Atkin LJ observed inSociété d'Avances Commerciales (Société Anonyme Egyptienne) v Merchants' Marine Insurance Co(The “Palitana”):‘… I think that an ounce of intrinsic merit or demerit in the evidence, that is to say, the value of the comparison of evidence with known facts, is worth pounds of demeanour’Further, in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. Considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. This does not eliminate the established principles about witness credibility; but it tends to reduce the occasions where those principles are seen as critical.”My consideration of the testimony of the witnesses causes me to somewhat favour Mr Bowling’s evidence to thatofMr Way. However,for the reasons explained inFox v Percy,I am not willing to reach afinalconclusion as to which ofthemis to be believed based only onmatters such as this.A far more reliable indication emerges from aconsideration ofmore objectively reliable matters. In particular, whenthe diariesare consideredin the context of the evidence as a whole, I am leftin no doubt that the entries purporting to record the payment of $20 to Mr Bowling on a regular fortnightly basis in the periodfrom8July 2021to 18 August 2022 are not reliable.My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.First,from8July 2021 the diariesdo not accuratelyaccord withfacts that are otherwise ascertainable.As I have already explained, there are some quite serious anomalies in the diary entries duringthis period.According to the diaries:Mr Way was paying Mr Bowling the sum of $20 at a time when, if he were a member of the syndicate, his contribution would have been $15(even thoughMr Bowlinghad clearly been honest with Mr Way about changes toprices in the past); Mr Bowling was taking small winnings but not telling Mr Way about them (contrary to his earlier practice); Mr Way was paying for tickets on days he did not receive his pension (which, though hardly decisive in and of itself, is noteworthy in the context of the other anomalies); Mr Way paid $20 for the lottery on both 11 and 18 August 2022 (which would have been completely out of the ordinary for this syndicate because Mr Bowling only ever purchased syndicate tickets fortnightly); and, relatedly, Mr Bowling took $20 from Mr Way for the syndicate on 18 August even though, by this time,Mr Bowlingknew the syndicate had already won over $5,000,000.Mr Way’s explanation for all of these anomalies was the same, namely that Mr Bowling was generally dishonest. Butthe argument that he was generally dishonest was, essentially, based on little more than the proposition that he (Mr Bowling) generally contradicted Mr Way’s account, which was corroborated by a diary. This process of reasoning was not of particular assistance in resolving the issues in dispute.Counsel for Mr Way made a number of submissions concerning the fact that, as I already noted above at [33], Mr Bowling would use money from the punters’club that he ran to lend to Mr Way from time to time. This, according to Mr Way, was evidence that Mr Bowling was dishonest and had no inhibition when it came to dealing with other peoples’money. In response to questions about this MrBowling admitted that he did sometimes use the funds pooled for the punters’club to service Mr Way’s requests but that he was diligent about making sure the funds were reconciled before the end of the year when the pooled funds were distributed amongst the members. Mr Bowling also gave evidence that he kept a book recording the contributions and winnings of the club. Mr Bowling’s explanation for using the punters’club funds to loan to Mr Waywasthat it was readily available cash and that it meant Mr Bowling did not have to go to the bank every time Mr Way asked for money, which was not infrequent.I do not accept Mr Way’s submission that Mr Bowling’s dealings with the punters’club funds tends to suggest he is dishonest and irresponsible withother peoples’money. He was careful to make surethatall of the funds added up by the end of the yearand he could do so with reference to his books. He trusted Mr Way to repay the loans, which Mr Way did. In truth, these transactions were informal arrangements between friends and neighbours, not highlevel banking.A consideration of the evidence generally inclines me to the view that Mr Bowling was generally reliable.On any view of the evidence, he did account to syndicate members for small winnings prior to July 2021and he did tell syndicate members when the price of tickets changed, just as he said. I have already explained why, in some respects, I have preferred his evidence as to some of the discussions he had with Mr Way about critical matters.In my view, the reason the diaries suggest such a divergence from Mr Bowling’s previous practice is that, from8July 2021, the entries do not reliably record the dealings between Mr Way and Mr Bowling in relation to the purchase of lottery tickets.Further, it is important to notice that the parties were living in close proximity during the whole of therelevant period and thatafter the fight about young Barry, the relationship between Mr Way, on the onehand, and the defendants, on the other, returned to an even keel.They continued to socialise. They were in and out of one another’s houses.They continued to cook meals and share them with one another and other neighbours. Mr Way’sdiaries record numerous references to Mr Bowling in this period, including references to borrowing money from him and repaying it,borrowing money for beer,drinking or borrowing six-packs of beer and so on. Even on Mr Way’s account they were perfectly sociable even after the Lotto win.These aspects of their relationship are very difficult to reconcile withMr Way’s case theory, namelythat Mr Bowling was beingdeeplydishonestwith Mr Wayabout the lottery syndicateeven before the win. This is especially so when it is remembered that Mr Way’s own diaries demonstrate thatMr Bowlinghad been honest about the syndicate previously.Mr Way’s case would require meto find that Mr Bowling set out on a course of dishonest dealing long before the win in August 2022 and that he carried on with this deception while otherwise interacting and socialising with Mr Way in his customary manner. This strikes me as a most unlikely thing to have occurred. What was to be gained by systematically cheating his neighbour and friend out of $5 per fortnight for the lottery syndicate ($5 being the difference between the $20 which Mr Way claims to have been paying andthe amounthe should have been paying if he really was still a member of the syndicate)? Not much. On the other hand, Mr Bowling’s case requires me to find that Mr Way dishonestly recreated diary entries, but only once he learned that there was about $1,500,000 to be gained by doing so. This is an inherently more plausible theory.The numerous discrepancies between the diary entries and the otherwise verifiable facts make it all the more compelling.ConclusionsI amthereforenot persuaded that the entries in Mr Way’sdiariespurporting to record the payment of $20 to Mr Bowling between July 2021 and August 2022 are reliable. I am persuaded to a relatively high level of certainty that those entries were not made contemporaneously.That being so, I am unable to accept Mr Way’s evidence that he contributed to the purchase of the winning ticket. I am not persuaded that he did so.I find that he ceased contributing to the syndicate after the altercation about young Barry in September 2021.At some point around that time, he said that he did not want to play witha“dead person’s numbers”.By August 2022 the only members of the syndicate were Mr Bowling and Ms Posar.These conclusions mean that I am unable to accept Mr Way’s account ofhis contributions to the syndicate in the period preceding the win, and of his dealingswith Mr Bowling in relation to thewin. Given thatthe diary has been shown to be unreliablein those respects, I am unwilling to treatas reliable Mr Way’sother evidenceabout those matters.Mr Way put his case in different ways. On the conclusions I have reached, his case fails on all of them.So far as the law of contract is concerned, I do not acceptMr Way’s contentionthat theterms of theircontract did not require Mr Way to contribute funds to the purchase ofeachticket.There is simply no factual basis on which to make such a conclusion.I find that any contract which may have existed wassubject to a condition that each syndicate member was required to continue to contribute, either from cash or else from winnings on tickets to which they had contributed. In circumstances where, as I have found, Mr Way ceased contributing to the syndicate in 2021, the defendants did not breach the contract by failing to share their winnings with him.By that stage, their contract was no longer on footbecause Mr Way had long since failed to meet the condition that he continue to contribute.So far as the law of trust is concerned, I find thatthere was no relationship of trustee and beneficiary as between Mr Bowling and Mr Way in August 2022. Mr Way had long since stopped contributing to the syndicate and no part of the funds used by Mr Bowling to purchase the winning ticket were referable to contributions made by, or minor winnings owing to, Mr Way as a member of the syndicate. Their arrangement had come to an end.Next, I reject the plaintiff’s contention that there was a“common intention constructive trust”that came into existence here. There is no room for the operation of the principlesexplained inMuschinski v Dodds(1985) 160 CLR 583; [1985] HCA 78orBaumgartner v Baumgartner(1987) 164 CLR 137; [1987] HCA 59in circumstances where, as I have found, the plaintiffdid not contribute to the winning ticketand there was no common intention for any sort of legal relationship to persist beyond the ceasing of contributions: see alsoBrendan Wilfred King v Robert Lawrence Adams[2016] NSWSC 1798 [357]-[361] (Sackar J).Lastly, the parties were not in partnership. They were not carrying on a business in common with a view of profit at any stage:Partnership Act 1892(NSW), s 1.OrdersTheproceedings will be dismissed with costs. It will be necessary to make orders for the funds in Court to be paid out, however I will give the parties an opportunity to bring in short minutes of order to facilitate that payment.Theorderswill therefore be:Proceedings dismissed with costs.Parties to bring in short minutes of order by 4:00PM on Friday, 23 August 2024, dealing with the payment of funds out of Court.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The Court has power to make an order for costs under s 1335(2) of theCorporationsAct2001Cth(“Act”)and s98(1) of theCivil Procedure Act2005 (NSW)(“CPA”)and r 42.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)(“UCPR”).

InCommonwealth of Australia vGretton[2008] NSWCA 117 at [121], Hodgson JA (with whom Mason P agreed) observed that:“… underlying both the general rule that costs follow the event, and the qualifications to that rule, is the idea that costs should be paid in a way that is fair, having regard to what the court considers to be the responsibility of each party for the incurring of the costs.”That observation was cited, with apparent approval, by the Court of Appeal inHeath v Greenacre Business Park Pty Ltd[2016] NSWCA 34 at [98] and, inCellaritPty Ltd vCawarrahHoldings Pty Ltd (No 2)[2018] NSWCA 266 at [7]-[14], McColl JA summarised the applicable principles as follows:“Section 98 of theCivil Procedure Act2005 (NSW) confers a wide discretion on the court with respect to costs. The general rule is that court costs follow the event unless the court makes some other order pursuant to the discretion conferred by Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR) r 42.1.As Beazley JA explained inBaker v Towle[(2008) 39 Fam LR 323; [2008] NSWCA 73 at [11] (Mathews AJA agreeing)], in most litigation, UCPR r 42.1 “operates in a straightforward way, ‘the event’ being readily identifiable as a judgment for the plaintiff or the defendant on the claim. In that sense, ‘the event’ to which the rule refers is the result of the proceedings, so that the party who succeeds on the claim before the court is awarded costs, unless the court, pursuant to the discretion conferred by r 42.1, makes ‘some other order’”.Underlying both the general rule that costs follow the event, and qualifications to that rule, is the idea that costs should be paid in a way that is fair, having regard to what the court considers to be the responsibility of each party for the incurring of the costs.”Mr Izzo, with whom Mr Boyle appears for KT, also submits and I accept that“[t]he disposition which is ultimately to be made in any case where there are competing considerations will reflect a broad evaluative judgment of what justice requires”:Gray v Richards [No 2][2014] HCA 47 at [2] (French CJ, Hayne, Bell,Gagelerand Keane JJ).MrPotts, whoappears for the Plaintiffsin respect of costs, alsopointstoBostik Australia Pty Ltd vLiddiard(No 2)[2009] NSWCA 304 at [38], where the Court of Appeal noted that, where there are multiple issues in a case, the Court generally does not attempt to differentiate between the issues on which a party was successful and those on which it failed. However, the Court also therepointed to several circumstances in which a different approach might be justified, and noted that:“Whether an order contrary to the general rule of costs follow the event should be made depends on the circumstances of the case viewed against the wide discretionary powers of the Court, which powers should be liberally construed.”InMobisParts Australia Pty Ltd v XL Insurance Company SE (No 2)[2019] NSWCA 19 at [5], the Court of Appeal noted that:“There is no issue as to the relevant principles. The discretion underCivil Procedure Act2005 (NSW), s 98 is ordinarily exercised by requiring that costs follow the event: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 42.1. This default position was historically understood to mean (so as to preserve the practice, where any issue was tried with a jury, that those costs followed the outcome of that event) that the costs of the several issues went to the party who succeeded on them respectively, while the general costs went to him who on the whole succeeded on the action … But more recent authority favours the award of the costs of proceedings to the party successful overall without any differentiation as to issues, at least unless a particular issue or group of issues is clearly dominant or separable … And the costs arising from such issues have more readily been apportioned where the party successful overall is the plaintiff …” [citations omitted]Mr Izzo in turn submits that, where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings, any question of apportionment is recognised as being very much a matter of discretion, the exercise of which“will often depend upon matters of impression and evaluation”:Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd[1993] FCA 259; (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272 perGummow, French and Hill JJ).MrPottssubmitsthat KT should pay their costs of the separate questions heard by the Court on the basis that they have had“substantial success”and costs should follow the event.He providesapartial outline of the circumstances which gave rise to the dispute between the parties, including steps taken by KT to seek to appoint his brother, Mr Anthony Turner(“AT”), as a director of severalDefendants by the purported exercise of the chair’s casting vote for each of those companies.He alsorefersto the narrowing of the issues in the proceedings, shortly after they were commenced on 3 June 2024, by the Points of Defence filed by KT which accepted that KT was not the director of severalcompanies and admitted that Ms Richards was a director of several companies. The Plaintiffs submit that that involved a“significant capitulation”in relation to a significant part of the proceedings.That submission does not advance the Plaintiffs’position as to costswhere that position was taken promptly, before the parties were put to any significant costs of running the proceedings and was an appropriate and proper step to narrow the scope of the proceedings.MrPottsalso pointsto a further narrowing of the proceedings on 1 July 2024, when KT did not press an earlier position that Ms Hooker’s appointments as a director of twocorporate Defendantswere invalid.MrPottssubmitsthat, as a matter of substance, the outcome of the hearing of the separate question was that it was either conceded or established that AT was not validly appointed to many of the corporateDefendants; that Ms Richards was a director of many corporateDefendants; and Ms Hooker was a director of two corporateDefendants; and he submitsthat that amounted tothe Plaintiffs’“substantive and substantial”success in the proceedings.That approach pays too little attention tothe numerous questions which the parties sought to have the Court determine,as to which both parties had mixed results.MrPottsalso submitsthat the individual issues on which thePlaintiffslost did not occupy the majority of the preparation time, evidence or hearing time; part of that proposition is assertion, so far as preparation time is concerned,andpart turns upon an analysis which is difficult and uncertain so far as the allocation of hearing timeis concerned.MrPottsthensubmitsthat thePlaintiffsshould be awarded costs because they have been“substantially successful”in the proceedings in the vindication of their rights. I do not accept that proposition, wherethe result in theseparate questions that I was asked to determine was mixed.Mr Izzoin turn submits that, consistent with the preliminary view expressed in paragraph 132 of myjudgment, thereshouldbe no order as to costs to date with the intention that the parties should bear their own costs. He submits that that resultwould reflect a fair apportionment of responsibility for costs, in the light of the mixed outcome in the issues in the proceedings. He identifies the issues that were determined by the separate questions,includingquestionswhether KT had been appointed chair of the Heartlandgroup; whether the appointment of AT as director of several companies had expired, and issues as the application of ss 259C, 259D and 1322 of theActin the relevant circumstances.Mr Izzosubmits thatKThad a measure of success on the“chair issue”; I do not accept that proposition, where, whatever his success in interim steps, I did not find that he had been appointed as chair of the Heartlandgroup.However,I accept that KT was successful in respect of the issues as to the application of ss259C, 259D and 1322 of theActwhich had a degree of factual and legal complexity. I see little utility in assessing the outcome of the proceedings from a commercial perspective, where that isspeculative; however, if I were to take that approach, there would also be force in KT’s submissions that he was successful in establishing the position for which he contended in respect of control of Heartland Group Pty Ltd, which is a significant matter where it is the holding company for companies within theHeartland group.For these reasons, I continue to take the view which I expressed, then as a preliminary view in thejudgment, thatthere should be no order as to the costs of the separate questions.OrdersAccordingly, I make the following orders:The Court declares that in the events which have happened:1.The fourteenth defendant, Mr Anthony Turner is not, and has never been, a director of:a)the third defendant, Heartland Group Pty Ltd;b)the fourth defendant,BoydedIndustries Pty Ltd;c)the fifth defendant, HMG Parts Pty Ltd;d)the sixth defendant, Heartland Motors Pty Ltd;e)the seventh defendant, Heartland Blacktown Pty Ltd;f)the eighth defendant, Heartland Penrith Pty Ltd;g)the ninth defendant, Chicago Properties Pty Ltd;h)the tenth defendant, T S Management Pty Ltd;i)the eleventh defendant, BGW Nominees Pty Ltd;

Where that occurs before there has been a hearing on the merits and leaving only a dispute as to costs, generally the Court will make no order as to the parties’costs.However, a different outcome may follow where what is presented as aresolution or sensible approach by one sideis in fact a capitulation.This judgment deals with that distinction, where it is said that the plaintiff gradually capitulated during the course of a hearing before me ofthree proceedingswhichwere the final iteration ofa dispute about apropertyat Galston.The litigationhas run for severalyears andoccupieda number ofjudges of this Division and the Court of Appeal.In the originating dispute, the plaintiffisDrRenukaMendonca,and thedefendantsareMrMark Tonnaand MrsLorraineTonna (to whom I referwithout disrespect astheTonnas).InTonna v Mendonca[2019] NSWSC 1849, Ward CJ in Eq (as the President then was) determined that Dr Mendonca held thepropertyon resulting trust for herselfandtheTonnas.TheTonnashadalleged that Dr Mendonca had contravened an agreement reached by Mr Tonna and Dr Mendonca’s husband (as agent for Dr Mendonca and also in his capacity as agent and accounting adviser to theTonnas) whereby Dr Mendonca would purchase thepropertyfrom theTonnasand would hold the legal title on trust for their sole benefit until the sale of anotherpropertyowned by theTonnasat Schofields, with an obligation eventuallytotransfer thepropertyto them. Dr Mendonca had denied that such agreement existed.Her Honour also dismissed Dr Mendonca’s separate claims for damages for a breach of a residential tenancy agreement which was allegedly entered into between the parties, but which Mr Tonna denied ever existed.Both of the findingsreferred to in the preceding paragraphswere upheld by the Court of Appeal inMendonca v Tonna[2020] NSWCA 196.Ward CJ in Eq alsothendetermined the parties’beneficial interest in theproperty-theTonnasas to 28.87% and Dr Mendonca as to 71.13%:Tonna v Mendonca (No 2)[2020] NSWSC 306.I shall refer to these as theInterests.On 4 June 2021, in the RealPropertyList, Justice Darke made orders under s 66G of theConveyancing Act 1919(NSW) for the appointment of trustees for the sale of thepropertyand how the proceeds for the sale were to be applied.Dr Mendoncaand theTonnaswere allowed to bid at the auction. Subsequently, Mr Hathaway and Mr Hosking became theTrusteesfor thesale of the property.The auction of thepropertyon the instructions of the Trustees took place on 18 September 2021. TheTonnaswere successful with a bid of $4million, over-bidding DrMendonca.However, theTonnas’initially only raised $3.5 million to make the purchase. TheTrustees then issued several notices to complete to theTonnas. TheTonnaswere only able to completetheir purchasebytakinga loan fromMrJosephSaliba.TheTonnas’purchase of thepropertysettled on 21 December 2021.The Trustees hold theproceedsin accordance with Darke J’sorders.The three proceedings before me are thelitigiousfalloutofthat sale process.From September 2023 I casemanaged themto a hearing to bring all issues in dispute between the parties to an end.TheTrustee Remuneration Proceedings(2021/115917)concernanamendednotice ofmotion filed by the Trustees on 28 September 2023forthe payment of their remuneration and expenses/disbursements.Dr Mendoncachallengedwhether the remuneration sought by the Trusteeswasreasonable.TheNegligence Proceedings(2022/264829)relate to the allegations raised by Dr Mendonca in heramendedstatement ofclaim filed on 19 February 2024(ASC). This raiseda litany of allegations relating to the conduct of the TrusteesandtheTonnasduring the sale of theproperty, including that the Trustees preferred theTonnas’interests, denied Dr Mendonca procedural fairness by failing to consult with her on various matters related to the sale, andalso contendedthat a substantial part of the Trustees’remuneration and disbursements should be borne bytheTonnasbecause of their conduct during the sale process. It was also alleged that the loan that Mr Salibahadprovided to theTonnaswas void for illegality.TheInterpleader Proceedings(2022/7598)are an interpleader action. The Trustees commenced the proceedings by summons seeking an order that they pay intoCourtfundscomprisinga principal sum of $505,382.64 and interest in the amount of $15, 284.51 inresponseto a garnishee order whichtheTonnashad successfullyobtained in relation to a costs judgment theTonnashad against Dr Mendonca. Both Dr Mendonca andtheTonnassubsequently filednotices ofmotionclaiming entitlementto thefunds.The three proceedings were listed for hearing before me for three dayscommencingon 2 April 2024. Asis set out in detailbelow, Dr Mendoncaindicatedat various points throughout the hearing that she no longer wished to press various parts of her ASC, contest the remuneration sought by the Trustees, or challenge theTonnas’entitlement to the funds. The effect of the numerous concessions provided by Dr Mendonca was that the Court was not required to determine the merits of any of her allegations.At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties weredirected to agree to a set of short minutes reflecting the positions on issues which had been agreed between the parties throughout the hearing. Those orders were made on 10 April 2024. As part of those orders the parties were given an opportunity to file and serve submissions concerning the costs of each of the proceedings for me to determine on the papers. This judgment resolves the issue of costs in the proceedings as between the parties.Mr D Stewart of Counsel provided submissions fortheTonnas, Mr S Phillips of Counsel providedsubmissions for the Trustees. Dr Mendoncaprepared her ownsubmissions.For the reasons which follow, theoverall outcome (with some minor variations between the proceedings) is that theCourt willorder Dr Mendonca to pay the other parties’costs.Trustee Remuneration Proceedings- proceduralhistoryThese proceedings were commenced by Dr Mendonca bysummons filed on 26 April 2021. On 4 June 2021, Darke J made orders under s 66G of theConveyancing Act 1919(NSW) for the appointment oftrustees for the sale ofthe propertyand as to how the proceeds of any sale were to be applied. Relevantly for present purposes,order 5 authorised the Trustees to“charge at their usual hourly professional rates subject to the total sum not exceeding $20,000”and also allowed them to“deduct such expenses from the proceeds of sale.”Foreseeing further scope for argument between the parties, order 7 stipulated that the successful party to the auctioncouldnot apply the benefit of any asserted set-off entitlements or adjustments against the purchase price. These orders were substantially consistent with the orders sought by Dr Mendonca in her summons.The auctionof the propertytook place on 18 September 2021 with theTonnasmaking the successful bid of $4 million. Initially,theTonnaswere only able to raise $3.5 million to make the purchase. The transaction was then subject to a notice to complete by the Trustees.On 3 December 2021,theTonnasfiled a notice of motion seeking to vary the orders of Darke J, which would have enabled them to complete thepurchaseby only paying $3,056,597.79 to the Trustees and set off the remaining amount by relying on extant costs ordersthey had against Dr Mendonca. On 6 December 2021,sitting as Duty Judge,I dismissed theTonna’snotice ofmotion on the basis that it was inappropriate to vary the orders made by Darke J on the basis his Honour had expressly considered a set-off should not be allowedto avoid the partiesprolongingtheir dispute:Mendonca v Tonna[2021] NSWSC 1627 (Kunc J judgment).On that occasion, the Trustees also foreshadowed their intention to apply to the Court to increase the amount to which theywereentitled to charge abovethe $20,000amountset out in Order 5 of Darke J’soriginalorders.On 16 May 2022, the Trustees filed anotice ofmotionfor orders including:1. That in addition to the remuneration referred to in order5 of the orders made by the Court on 4 June 2021, the Court approves the Trustee’s further remuneration in the sum of $132,108 plus GST or such other sum as the Court may determine, plus GST.2.Anorder that the applicants’external expenses and disbursements incurred in their performance astrustees, be paid out of, or reimbursed from, the proceeds of the sale of the property situated at XXXXGalston NSW 2159.3. An order that the applicants’costs of and incidental to this application be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the land situated atXXXX, Galston NSW 2159 on an indemnity basis.TheTrustees’motion wasultimatelylisted for hearing before Hammerschlag CJ in Eq.On 1 February 2023,his Honourdetermined thatorder 5 made by Darke J on 4 June 2021 did not finally limitto $20,000theTrustees’entitlement to charge fortheirservices and disbursements. His Honour also made directions for theTrustees to provideDr Mendoncaand theTonnasany further documentation to enable them to determine their positionin relation tothe remuneration application. Registrar Walton then made further directions on 5 April 2023 for Dr Mendonca and theTonnasto serve further evidence by 10 May 2023 and the Trustees to file and serve any affidavits in reply by 31 May 2023. That timetable was extended on 7 June 2023. On that occasion the matter was also referred to court annexed mediation, but the matter did not settle when the mediation took place on28 July2023.On 14 August 2023, the matter was listed for hearing before me for three days commencing on 2 April 2024. On 28 September 2023 I commenced case-managing this proceeding, together with the other two proceedings. On thatoccasion, I granted leave to the Trustees to file in Court an amendednotice of motion and, given Dr Mendonca’s challenge to the Trustees’remuneration,noted that the parties would endeavour to agree upon a referee and the terms of that reference with the intention of submitting consent orders to the Court for the disposition of the issues in that proceeding.The Trustees’amendednotice ofmotionsought orders including:1. That the Court approves the Trustees’remuneration:a. In the amount of $152,108.00 plus GST for the period between 4 June 2021 and 31 January 2022.b. In the amount of $38,618 plus GST for the period between 1 February 2022 to 9 March 2023; andc. In the amount of $30,957.00 plus GST for the period between 10 March 2023 and the date of these orders.d. Or such other sum as the Court may determine2. An order that the applicants’ external expenses and disbursements (including legal fees and disbursements) incurred in their performance astrustees be paid out of, or reimbursed from, the proceeds of the sale of thepropertysituatedat XXXXGalston NSW 221593.An order that the applicants’ costs of and incidental to this application be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the land situated at XXXX Galston NSW 2159 on an indemnity basis, such payment to be made prior to any payment being made from the proceeds to any other party to the proceedings.On 24 October 2023, I made orders by consent appointingMrHenry McKenna as thereferee.Mr McKennawas required to answer the following questions:Whether the amount of remuneration claimed by the Trustees in theamendednotice ofmotion (being a total of $221,683 plus GST) for the period from 4 June 2021 to 10 March 2023 is fair and reasonable.If the answer to 1 is no, what would be a fair and reasonable amount of remuneration for the Trustees for the period from 4 June 2021 to 10 March 2023.Insofar as Dr Mendonca contends work undertaken by theTrustees was negligent or unnecessary or similar, what is the fair and reasonable amount of remuneration for the Trustees for such work without having regard to or deciding the correctness of Dr Mendonca’s contentions.Mr Mckenna completed hisreferee’sreporton 29 January 2024.In response to question 1, Mr McKenna concluded that the Trustees’timesheet entries were mostly fair and reasonable although he believed that there should be some entries reduced or removed.In response toquestion 2, Mr McKenna provided thistable, being a reduction of13.3% and which was accepted by the Trustees before me:Calculation of reasonable Trustees time costs (excluding GST)$Trustees’time costs 24 June 2021 to 24 October 2023$221,683.00Less–reduction for excessive time charged for the tasks described$8,530.50Less–reduction for time charged with inadequate narrative$3,652.00Less–reduction for duplicate timesheet entries or tasks by others$1,261.50Less–reduction for handover time$586.00Less–Reduction for time incurred in applying for remuneration$15,479.50Less–reduction for time allocated to the wrong job code$78.00Reasonable remuneration for the Trustees$192,095. 50In relation to question 3,Mr McKenna did not consider thatany of theworkundertaken by the Trustees was negligent or unnecessary.On 2 February 2024, Dr Mendonca filed anotice ofmotion seeking the following orders:1. Leave granted to the applicant to file and serve Notice of Motion seeking below orders.2. An order that parties should bear the ordinary cost of the sale of thePropertyin the ratio of their sharing in the proceeds of sale being ratio of their beneficial interest.3. An order that the difference between total, fair and reasonable and just costs determined by referee or Court in relation to question number 2 or 3 (whichever number is lower) and the ordinary costs of both trustees and their solicitor be borne solely by theTonnasand be deducted out of theTonnasshare of the net proceeds of sale.4. An order that the trustees bear their own costs (fees and legal costs) or in the alternative trustees fees and/or trustees legal representatives legal costs and applicant’s legal costs as agreed or assessed in relation to 2021/115917 be deducted out of theTonnasshare of the net proceeds of sale.On 14 February 2024,I made directions for the parties to file and serve submissions as to whether thereferee’s report should be adopted, file andserve submissions as to any adjustments which should be made to Dr Mendonca’sInterest in the proceedsafter deduction of the costs and expenses of the Trustees,andrequiredtheTrustees to file an application for assessment of the costs of their former solicitor, Mr John Breene of Breene& Breene. I also ordered that all three proceedings be heard together with evidence in one being evidence in the other.On 16 March 2024, Dr Mendonca filed afurthernotice ofmotion seeking theseorders:1. An order to vary or set aside order 3 made on 14 February 2024 by Kunc J and/or grant permanent stay under s 67 ofCivil Procedure Act 2005of application for assessment of trustee solicitors costsfiledon 29 January 2024 time barred by statute, if applicant’s primary position served on 10 March 2024 pursuant to orders made by Kunc J is not accepted.2. An order declaring trustee’s duty towards beneficiaries is paramount and it must put the intent of beneficiaries first being it is not in the interest of Dr. Mendonca and/or Mark and Lorraine Tonna to seek an extension of time to pursue an application for assessment of trustee solicitors costs, if applicant’s primary position served on 10March 2024 pursuant to orders made by Kunc J is not accepted.3. Costs be costs in the cause (costs in the trial).On 27 March 2024, I stood thisfurthermotion over to be heard at the main hearingto commenceon 2 April 2024.At the hearing,Dr Mendoncainformed methat the gravamen of her complaintwas that the Trustees were out of time in filing the application for the costs assessment. This breach of the limitation period was cured by a decision of the Manager, Cost Assessment of this Court dated26 March 2024who exercised their discretion to extend the time within which the application was brought. Dr Mendonca sought the stay because she saidthat the extension of time was not in her interests as a beneficiary of the trust because the trust estate(the Proceeds)would bear the costs of an assessment that was brought out of time and, to use herdescription, was‘statute-barred’.I assumed for the purposes of themotionthat Dr Mendonca hadstanding to bring the application, bearing in mind that a beneficiary generally only has a right to due administration of the trust estate. However, I dismissed themotionbecause Dr Mendonca failed to establish any basis upon which I could set aside the decision of the Manager, Costs Assessment. Furthermore, evenifI could do so,I did not accept that it was not in heror theTonnas’interests for theTrustees’solicitors’costs to be assessed. In my respectful view, it was plainly in the interests of all parties to ensure that only the amount which is properlypayableto the solicitors in respect of their costs is levied against theproceeds.In opening, Mr Phillips informed the Courtthattherewere two issues left to address in these proceedings:Whether the Court should adopt thereferee’s reportto resolve the Trustees’requestforthe Court approve their remuneration. Mr Phillips conceded that thereferee’s report superseded the amounts sought in the Trustees’amendednotice of motion filed inCourt on 28 September 2023(see [24] above).Forthe Court to approve the amount oftheTrustees’legal costsforwhichthey could be reimbursed from the proceeds.In relation to thesecondissue, all the parties accepted that the Court should make an order providing for those costs to be paid as assessedfrom the proceeds. Dr Mendonca was concerned to ensure thattheTonnaspaid the portion of costs which related to theirnotice ofmotion filed on 3 December 2021 which Ihaddismissedin the Kunc J judgment(see [19] above).This position was already concededby Mr Stewartinhiswritten opening submissions. Therefore, Iaskedthe partiestoproduce short minutes outlining that the Trustees would be entitled to have theirassessedsolicitors’costs out of theproceeds,with a notation thattheTonnasagreedthey hadto pay theTrustees’costs associated with their(theTonnas’)unsuccessful3 December 2021notice of motion.The parties’positionsin relation tothe first issue were notunanimous.The Trustees andtheTonnasconsented to the Court adoptingthe referee’sreport as the amount of remunerationto which the Trustees wereentitled. However, Dr Mendonca challenged thereferee’sreport on the basis thatshe submittedtherefereehadincorrectly determined that there were no negligent actsby theTrusteeswhich would justify their remuneration beingfurtherreduced.In both written and oral submissions, Dr Mendonca contended that the Trusteeshadbreachedwhat sheconsideredwas theirduty at general law andanobligation pursuant to s 66H of theConveyancing Act1919(NSW)to consult withherabout matters relating to the sale. Dr Mendonca submitted that the Trustees should have consulted her when they realised on or about 19 July 2021 that they were going to exceed the remuneration estimate of $20,000. Itwasher contention that had she been consulted theTrustees would have been replaced by the existing solicitors and realestate agents and this would have reduced costs. Dr Mendoncasubmittedthat thepartieswould havebeensaved $48,000 had theTrustees been replaced by thesolicitorsbecausethesolicitors’fees were only $99,000 as at 20 July 2021 compared to the Trustees’feesof$147,000.Dr Mendonca also relied on s 66Htoarguethat the Trustees should have consulted her at the pointatwhich the Trustees issued a second notice to complete totheTonnason 8 December 2021. She saysthat if they haddone so,she would have informed them that she had obtained a loan from a bank and was willing to pay$4.1 million for theproperty. Therefore, thepartiesweredeprivedof$100,000, being the extra amount that Dr Mendonca was willing to bidin excess ofwhat theTonnasactually paid.Finally, Dr Mendonca also suggested that the Trustees were negligent in not charging theTonnasan occupation fee from 4 June 2021 until21 December 2021and therefore the Trustees may be liable for damages of up to $18,000.In summary, Dr Mendonca challenged thereferee’s report by contending thatthere should be a further reduction in the Trustees’remuneration of$166,000 for the reasons outlinedat [38]to[40] above.In response,Mr Phillips submitted that Dr Mendonca had failed to identify any error which thereferee had madeinhow the report has been prepared. I invitedthe parties to consider whether they pressedforthe answer to question 3of the report to be adopted. Mr Stewart pressed forthat outcomebut accepted that the Court was not bound by thereferee’s conclusion that he would not reduce the amount of remunerationto whichthe Trustees were entitled because of a lack of evidence as to whether there was any negligence.I concurred with Mr Stewart’s submission that I was not bound by thereferee’s opinion that there was no negligence on behalf of the Trustees. I inquired of Dr Mendonca as to whether she would accept the report if I limited the response toquestion 3, namely that he“does not consider that work undertaken by the Trustees was negligent or unnecessary”as a matter of opinion and that theCourt would still be required to determine if the Trustees’conducthad been negligent in the ways she alleged.On this basis, Dr Mendonca agreed that the Court should accept thereport in its entirety (Tcpt, 2 April 2024, p 33 (25)).After the morning tea break, Dr Mendonca informed theCourt that she had decided that shewouldaccept the referee’sreportin its entiretyand only press her claim in relation to apportionmentas tohow costswere to be dealt with as between herself andtheTonnas(Tcpt, 2 April 2024, 35 (39-44)). To be clear, Dr Mendonca subsequently agreed that she did not dispute thereferee’s conclusion that the Trustees should be paid $192,000 for their fees (Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p. 39(44-47)).There wasalsoa dispute as to whethertheTonnasin fact owed Dr Mendonca rental income in proportionto theirInterestsfor the period 19 December 2021 (the date of Ward CJ in Eq’s judgment concerning the co-ownership status of theproperty) and the date thatthe Trustees were appointed on 4 June 2021. It was accepted that this amount should come from theTonnas’share of the net proceeds.At the conclusion of the hearing, I requested the partiesto prepareshort minuteswhichreflectedthe various concessions and agreementsbetweenthem. On 3 April 2024, I madethe followingorders in relation to these proceedings:Proceedings 2021/1159171 An order that the report of Henry McKenna (Referee) dated 29 January 2024 be adopted by the Court in its entirety.2 An order that inclusive of the remuneration referred to in order 5 of the orders made by the Court on 4 June 2021, the Court approves the Trustees’ total remuneration in the sum of $195,095.50 (excluding GST), being the calculation of reasonable remuneration for the Trustees made by the Referee in his report dated 29 January 2024.…..Proceedings 2021/115917[Orders 7 to 10 were overtaken by events and are not relevant]11 Submissions as to costs are to be served and filed by email to the associate to Kunc J as follows:(a) By the trustees and theTonnason or before 10 April 2024.(b) By Dr Mendonca on or before 17 April 2024.(c) By any party in response on or before 24 April 2024.12. Liberty to any party to apply on 2 days’ notice by email to the associate to Kunc J .On 5 April 2024, pursuant to the slip rule I amended Order 2 made on 3 April 2024 by deleting the sum of $195, 095.50 and replacing it with the sum of $192, 095.50.On 10 April 2024, I then made thesefurtherorders andnotations to give effect to the parties’further agreements as to the working out of the Court’s orders:Proceedings 2021/115917NotationsA. The Court notes that the terms and references used below are the same as those used in the orders made by the Court on 3 April 2024.B.

In the alternative, they seek an order that Dr Mendonca bear 90% of the costs of the Trustees’remuneration and legal costs andtheTonnasbe liable for 10%. This 10% isputon the basis thattheTonnasdid initially oppose the quantum of the remuneration and legal costs sought by the Trustees.The costs order sought against Dr Mendonca was saidto be justified on the basis that she unreasonably sought to challenge the Trustees’remuneration,only to then accept thereferee’s report and the(to be assessed)costs ofthe Trustees’solicitors.TheTonnasrelied on Darke J’sobservationsinStibbard-Leaver v Leaver[2021] NSWSC 65:[5] I observe at this point that in litigation of this type under s 66G of the Conveyancing Act, it is usual to order that the costs of the proceedings be paid out of the proceeds of sale. The rationale for this approach is that the costs of such an application are an incident of joint ownership (seeKardosvSarbutt(No 2)[2006] NSWCA 206 at [28]). It remains the case of course that unreasonable conduct by a party may be a basis to conclude that some other order is appropriate in a s 66G case.Lewin v Lewin[2019] NSWSC 380 is an example. In that case, it was held that certain unreasonable conduct led to an unnecessary incurring of costs. However, as I noted in that case (at [41]), a co-owner is ordinarily under no obligation to seek to avoid a need to bring a s 66G application (see alsoChow v Chow(No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1348 at [12] where it was stated by Young AJA that co-owners have no obligation to negotiate their dissolution).Whilst this is not expressly an application under s 66G of theConveyancing Act 1919(NSW), the principles outlined by Darke J are said to apply in this case by analogy.TheTonnasadvancedfive reasons why the position of Dr Mendoncawasunreasonable.First, Dr Mendonca was the only party that pressedthatthe work undertaken by the Trusteeswas negligent, unnecessary or similar. For example, she requested thereferee to consider what would be the fair or reasonable amount of remuneration for the Trustees if they assumed she was correctthat work undertaken by the Trustees was negligent, unnecessary or similar;she pressed duringthehearing that the Trustees were negligent;her claims went beyond negligence and overlapped with her claims in theNegligence Proceedings;and,she hadarguedagainst the adoption of the referee’s report because itdid not account for her allegationswithout everidentifying how there was any errorin thereport.Second, itwas submitted that Dr Mendonca had a prior opportunity to ventilate her concerns to thereferee and did so through her document called‘Brief Statement of Findings of Fact and Law’and therefore itwas incorrectfor her tosay she needed to press her allegations at the hearing because she had no prior opportunity to do so.Third, there was no basis for Dr Mendonca to refuse to accept the referee’s reportbecause it was obvious the referee had beenfair and independentofall parties.Fourth, even if the Court found that Dr Mendoncahadproperly identified an errorin the reportbecause itdid not take into accounther allegations of theTrustees’negligence,those allegations had been shown to be unmeritorious by the dismissal of the Negligence Proceedings.Fifth, Dr Mendoncahadrefused to accept that the costs of Breene & Breene should be paid at all,aswasdemonstrated by hernotice ofmotion filed on 16 March 2024 andamendednotice ofmotion filed on 2 April 2024 which sought orders that my order of 14February2024 be set aside or stayed,and sought an order that the application of the Trustees for an assessment of Breene &Breene’scosts filed on 24 February 2024 wasincompetent because it wastime barred. It was submittedthat Dr Mendoncawas unreasonable to press this application when she had received a letter from Registrar Bellach that granted an extension of time for the assessment to take place,and then sought to challenge theRegistrar’s decisionon various grounds including unreasonableness and jurisdictional error.Given Dr Mendonca then no longer sought to challenge thereferee’sreport, theTonnasrely onLewin v Lewin[2019] NSWSC 380, in whichDarke J said:[43] I have considered the defendant’s conduct in relation to the proceedings. I have come to the conclusion that it was unreasonable of the defendant, having made serious allegations againstthe plaintiff, to continue to resist the application for about 12 months before essentially capitulating. There is force in the submission that the defendant’s assertions to the effect thatthe plaintiff was not a co-owner of the Unit, were unfounded. The assertions were contrary to clear acknowledgements previously made by the defendant. It is clear that a considerable portion ofthe plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings would have been incurred as a result of the defendant’s continued resistance to the application.TheTonnasalso emphasise that they were not involved in the challenge to the referee’sreport, save as to a query how a remuneration estimate for $20,000 increased to $130,0000 and how a legal bill of $90,000 was levied against thetrust estate.Mr Stewart’s submission notedthattheTonnasagreed to an order that they pay $6,446.00 inclusive of GST from their part of the interim distribution, pursuant to order 4 of the 10 April 2024 orders,and agreed to the same order with respect to legal costs pursuant to order 6 of the 10 April 2024 orders.If theCourt were not minded to order Dr Mendonca pay the Trustees’costs,theTonnassubmitted that a reduction of 20% should be made to the costs sought by the Trustees. Two submissions were put forward in support of this proposition. First, itwas said that the Trustees’remuneration after it was considered by thereferee was reduced by approximately 13% meaning the beneficiaries hadhad anominal success in the proceedings. Second, itwas submittedthat the Trustees unjustifiably delayed the cost assessment process in circumstances where the parties were disputing their legal costs and their subsequent delay caused a dispute as to whether the assessment process was out of time. Had the Trustees acted promptly, theTonnascontended thatthe subsequent disputes wouldhavefallen away.In reply, the Trustees provided four reasons as to why a reduction of 20% should not be made:It would be inimical to the Trustees’rights to recoup everything expended by them in their capacity astrustees.The remuneration sought by the Trustees has already been subject to a 13% reduction by the Referee. Therefore, it would be inconsistentfor a further reduction of costs tobe made.There is no proper basis articulated by theTonnasas to why there should be any reduction applied to the Trustees’costs. None of the costs which the Trustees saywereproperly and fully quantified in theiraffidavitevidencewere challenged as being excessive, unreasonable or likely to be rejected if made the subject of an assessment.There is no proper basis for any further reduction, let alone a deduction in the magnitude of 20%. The Trusteessaidthey were willing to accept a 1.8% discount on their costs to reflect the usual position that a discount is normally applied to costs which are assessed on a gross sum basis.The Trustees also submittedthat any costs they bear in theseproceedings should be paid by Dr Mendonca. They submittedthat aSandersonorder should be madebecauseDr Mendonca was the true defendant in this case given her persistent challengesto the Trustees’remuneration andcosts and as such, she should be held responsible forall ofthe costs incurred.TheTonnasreject that Dr Mendonca achieved any of the relief she sought in theseproceedings or that her conduct wasnotunreasonable.They submitted that their initial opposition to the Trustees’remuneration resulted in thereferee being appointed and after thatappointment they did not oppose the relief sought by the Trustees.TheTonnasalso reject that they adopted a false position on the costs that were due and payableby reason ofmy 6 December 2021 orders. Mr Stewartsubmitted that his clientsalways accepted that they were liable to pay $6, 446.00 inclusive of GST.This amount is vastly different to the amount Dr Mendonca sought to havetheTonnaspay, being $63,037.00.TheTonnasfurthersuggestedthat Dr Mendonca’swrittensubmissions seek to reagitate a number of the issues she conceded during the hearing including: (a) the provenance of an excel spreadsheet from September; b) her loss of a valuable opportunity to remove theTrustees and their solicitors; (c) theextraneouscosts assessments, costs orders, costs certificates, costs judgments and costs reviews; (d)the out of time costs assessment;(e) the largeshed; (f)the tenancy agreement; (g) thenotice tocomplete; (h) her damages and losses; (i) a failureto relist; and, f) the assertion she had made offers.Trustee Remuneration Proceedings – theTrustees’submissions as to costsThe Trustees contended that the Court should make thesecosts orders:the Trustees’costs, as assessed (to the extent necessary) on the indemnity basis, should be paid out of the fund held by the Trustees, before any apportionment or adjustments are made with respect to that fund;in lieu of assessment, a gross sum costs order should be made in favour of the Trustees in the sum of $205,000, to be apportioned as between the three proceedings as follows:Proceedings 2021/115917: $82,000Proceedings 2022/264829:$112,750Proceedings 2022/7598: $10,250.00In support of this position, the Trustees relied ona trustee’sright to recoup all expenses properly incurred in execution of the trustee’s powers pursuant to ss 59(4) and 93 of theTrustee Act1925 No 14(NSW) and r 42.25 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).Section59(4) of theTrustee Actprovides that“a trustee may reimburse himself or herself, or pay or discharge out of the trustpropertyall expenses incurred in or about execution of the trustee’s trusts or powers”. Section93(3) relevantlyprovidesthat“In any proceedings with respect to the management or administration of anypropertysubject to a trust or forming part of the estate of a testator or intestate, or with respect to the interpretation of the trust instrument, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order any costs to be paid out of such part of thepropertyas in the opinion of the Court is the real subject matter of the proceedings.“UCPR r 42.25(1) empowers theCourt to indemnify trustees for any costs incurred in similar terms to that outlined in s93 of theTrustee Act:42.25 Costs of trustee or mortgagee(1)  Subject to subrule (2), a person who is or has been a party to any proceedings in the capacity of trustee or mortgagee is entitled to be paid his or her costs in the proceedings, in so far as they are not paid by any other person, out of the fund held by the trustee or out of the mortgagedproperty, as the case may be.(2)  The court may order that the person’s costs not be so paid if—(a)  the trustee or mortgagee has acted unreasonably, or(b)  in the case of a trustee, the trustee has in substance acted for his or her own benefit rather than for the benefit of the fundThe Trustees alsodrew to attentionthat the general law also provides them with a similar entitlement to their costs. AsLeemingJA saidinPerpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Attorney General[2018] NSWSC 1456:[125] In all likelihood, the solicitors are entitled, as a matter of contract, to recover their costs, on a solicitor/client basis, from the trustee, ultimately (in the event of any dispute) through a process of assessment. To the extent that those costs have been properly incurred, the trustee is entitled to an indemnity from the assets of the trust. Indeed, the Court of Appeal (Sir GeorgeJesselMR, Cotton and Lindley LJJ) observed inTurner v Hancock(1882) 20 Ch D 303 that a trustee’s costs (like those of a mortgagee) being a matter of contract, they were not in the discretion of the Court, unless (as Cotton LJ put it at 306) “something has occurred to deprive the trustee of his right to take them out of the fund”.[126]It follows that without any order, in an application such as this which was properly made by the trustee, the trustee is entitled to recover all of its properly incurred costs in the exercise of its rights of exoneration or recoupment out of trust assets. Starke J inNational Trustees Executors and Agency Company of Australasia Ltd v Barnes(1941) 64 CLR 268 at 274; [1941] HCA 3 referred to the “rule acted upon by the Court of Chancery that an executor or trustee is entitled as of right to be recouped everything that he has expended properly in his character as executor or trustee”.[127]There has been a deal of statutory intervention in this area. As Payne JA pointed out inFree Serbian Orthodox Church Diocese for Australia and New ZealandPropertyTrust v Bishop IrinejDobrijevic (No 3)[2017] NSWCA 109 at [28] there are three statutory sources of power to order that the trustee be indemnified from trust assets in addition to the general law principle: s 59(4) of theTrustee Act, s 93 of theTrustee Actand UCPR r 42.25. Section 59(4) enacts the position at general law. The history of its Victorian and English counterparts is summarised inNational Trustees Executors and Agency Company of Australasia Ltd v Barnesat 277. Subsection 93(2) and r 42.25 gofurther and confer a power upon the Court to make an order for costs, and the latter expressly confers a power to order that the trustee’s costsnotbe paid. Thus, contrary to what had been held inTurner v Hancock, it is clear that the Court’s power extends to the circumstances when a trustee enjoys a right of indemnity.Relying on the matters set out in the immediately preceding paragraphs,the Trustees submit that unless either party is able to demonstrate that the Trustees have acted improperly or unreasonably, the Trustees are entitled to have paid from theproceedsall of their costs incurred with respect to the proceedings while acting as trustees with respect to the sale and the proceeds.More specifically,the Trustees submit that pursuant toUCPRr 42.25the Trustees should be paid out of theproceedswithout any apportionment as between the beneficiaries. This is justified on the basis that they were in substance the successful moving party in these proceedingsgiventhat their remuneration, costs and other disbursements and expenses incurred in their capacity astrustees were approved by the Court.In support of their gross sum costs order application, the Trustees rely on the affidavit of their solicitorMsWendyJacobsdated 11 April 2024. Ms Jacobs’affidavit outlines that the Trustees will have incurred $208,821.78 in costs. The Trustees submit thata1.8% discount should be applied to those costs, such thatthe total amount of the gross sum costsorderin the Trustees’favourshould be$205,000.Ms Jacobs’affidavit also providesa basis for theTrustees’coststobe apportioned across the three proceedings with 40% of the costs order being apportioned to theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings,55% totheNegligence Proceedingsand 5% totheInterpleader Proceedings.So apportioned,the total gross sum costs order which the Trustees submit should be madeis:Proceedings 2021/115917:$82,000.00Proceedings 2022/264829:$112,750.00Proceedings 2022/7598:      $10,250.00In addition to the gross sum costs order, the Trustees also seek an order for the payment of interest on the costs incurred by the Trustees with respect to the proceedings from the date such costs were incurred. Whilst it is not necessary for the Court to be aware of the dates on which costs were incurred before making such an order (seeDrummond v Rosen[2009] NSWCA 331 at [3])the Trustees provide evidence for when such costs were incurredinMs Jacobs’affidavit. In support of their application, the Trustees rely on s 101(4)-(5) of theCivil Procedure Act:S 101Interest after judgment…(4) Unless the court orders otherwise, interest is payable on an amount payable under an order for the payment of costs.(5) Interest on an amount payable under an order for the payment of costs is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at any other rate that the court orders, as from the date the order was made or any other date that the court orders.An order for the payment of interest to be paid is said to be consistent with the Trustees’entitlement to be indemnified by the fund.The three proceedings– Dr Mendonca’s submissionsIn support of her position as to the costs of the proceedings, Dr Mendonca filed a 106-page affidavit on 22 April 2024. Her submissions formed Annexure Z to that affidavit (pp. 81-103).They were, with respect, not always easy to follow and I accept the Tonna’s general criticisms of her submissions set out at [66] above.As will be apparent from what follows, she submitted the three proceedings should be seen as one and framed her submissions accordingly. It is therefore more straightforward to include all of her submissions under this heading.Dr Mendonca’s primary position is that because all three matters were heard together and‘ultimately consolidated into a single proceeding’by me on 14February 2024, there is no need to apportion the amount of costs in each proceeding. She contends that the Trustees’legal costs should be discounted by 20% and then otherwise the beneficiary parties pay their own costs.In the alternative, she contends thattheTonnasshould pay her legal costs on the indemnity or ordinary basis due to their‘unreasonable conduct and unlawful conduct’. Dr Mendonca submits thattheTonnas’capitulated in relation to the payment of rent to her between 20 December 2019 and 4 June 2021 as well as in relation to the land tax and mortgage issues.In support of her contention that theTonnasand Trustees acted unreasonably during the course of the hearing, Dr Mendonca submits that it was only after her cross-examination when I clarified that theTrustees’costs in relation to the proceedings before me on 6 December 2021 are to becompletely attributedtotheTonnas,thattheTonnasmade concessions in relation to which of the Trustees’costs they would pay. She submitted that the Trustees expressly or impliedly adoptedtheTonnas’position that the Trustees’costs in relation to the 6 December 2021 hearing be apportioned in proportion to beneficial ownership and as such invited litigation on the quantum of costs orders which unnecessarily protracted the proceedings. She also posits that the $63,037 she received from theTonnasto make up for lost rent was the most significant issue in theNegligence Proceedings and,on this basis, she was content to drop her other claims. Dr Mendonca also claims that the delays the Trustees took in getting their solicitors’costs assessed created unnecessary delays.In reply to theTonnas’submissions, Dr Mendonca sought to traverse all costs orders which she had in her favour againsttheTonnasand all of the times that the parties had been before the court and had failed to file and serve evidence on time.With respect to theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings, Dr Mendoncasubmitsthat she helped to narrow the issues in dispute by accepting thereferee’s report in totality after it was clarified that the Court would treat thereferee’s response to Question 3 that there was no negligence by the Trustees as an opinion of thereferee. Shecontends thatafter that it became unnecessary to determine the merits of this issue.Dr Mendonca submitsthat had the Trustees properly quantified their fees incurred in defence of theTonnas’3 December 2021 motiondetermined bymein the Kunc J judgment,she would have made similar concessions as she did during the hearing, namely beingto not have other apportionment issues dealt with on the merits.Dr Mendonca also rejects theTonnas’submissions that she unreasonably sought to challenge the Trustee’s remuneration and solicitors’fees. Dr Mendonca said that she accepted the first two sections of thereferee’s report and that it was not unreasonable for her to challenge the third section of the report as thereferee had allegedly contravened my direction to himthat he shouldnot consider the merits ofwhetherthere was any negligence by the Trustee(as opposed to quantifying what Dr Mendonca alleged was negligent). Dr Mendonca says that once it was clarified that I would determine the merits of any negligenceclaimand assume the amount thereferee would deduct would be nil, she says she reasonably accepted the report.Dr Mendonca also argues that she reasonably accepted the Trustees’solicitors costs after an offer by thesolicitors which she accepted. She also says it was not unreasonable for her to draw attention to the cost assessment beingbroughtout oftime.Dr Mendoncafurtheralleges that the conduct oftheTonnascaused the proceedings to continue into a second day. As outlined below, Dr Mendonca relies on a number of costs orders and agreements allegedly entered into between the parties and claims theTonnasmisrepresented my orders on 6 December 2021 to avoid having to pay the Trustees’fees:My reasonable conduct to accept at the start of trial the referee report in its entirety and not require a determination of all issues in relation to trustees in 2021/115917 and 2022/264829 would have enabled trial to conclude on Day 1 but instead unreasonably prolonged into Day 2 predominantly due to unreasonable conduct of Tonna parties as follows:1.To continue since 25 March 2020 misinterpreting and breaching until trial (with the benefit of legal advice and legal representation from Adams lawyers) the clear orders made by Justice Ward without seeking an extension of time to comply with Ward J orders and without availing of the opportunity provided by HerHonourin order 7 to relist the matter because, properly advised, Tonna parties knew or ought to know (being legally represented by Adams solicitors andBlackbaylawyers) that their (Tonna parties) objections to mortgage payments and insurance payments and land tax payments were unreasonable.2.To continue since 4 June 2021 breaching until trial on 2 April 2024 their (Tonnaparties) agreements before Justice Darke (a) in relation to set off against purchase price which resulted in judgment by Kunc Jon 6 December 2021 and (b) in relation to broader accounting regime which resulted in 2ndgarnishee order:As I have already noted (see [78] above),Dr Mendonca’s submissions also attempt to relitigate some of the concerns that she conceded she no longer pressed during the hearings. For example, she disputes that her conduct was unreasonable in relation to challenging the Trustees’costs by pressing that theTonnashad acted unreasonably by disputing whether the shedon the propertywas a fixture and by preventingher andthe Trustees from inspecting theproperty. She also contends that various pieces of evidence demonstrate thattheTonnasalso challengedaspects of the Trustees’remuneration. Finally, Dr Mendonca contends that hadtheTonnasaccepted they were required to pay the Trustees’costs of attending the 6 December 2021 hearing before me,that would have resolved all of the mattersbecausethatconsiderablyreduced the amount oftheTrustees’coststhat werein dispute.Dr Mendonca also rejects that she was the only party that contended that the work undertaken by the Trustees was negligent or similar.She extracted in her submissionsa number of timesinthe affidavit evidence wheretheTonnasalso sought to challenge the Trustees’remuneration:I wasnotthe only party that contended that the work undertaken by the trustees was negligent, unnecessary or similar.The evidence below/as follows establishes that Tonna parties also joined in this contention and contended until start of trial on 2 April 2024 that the work undertaken by the trustees was negligent, unnecessary or similar:2. \"Order declaring that the Notice to Complete from Stephen Wesley Hathaway and Philip Raymond Hosking to Mark JulianTonnaand LorraineMaryTonnaand Adams & Partners Lawyers dated 18 November 2021 is invalid\" {CB 660 at [1])3.\"I oppose the remuneration sought by the Trustees with respect to their costs and their legal costs on the basis that it is excessive\"(CB 2675 at [13] affidavit of Mark Tonna 7 July 2023).4.\"The remuneration sought was more than five times what had beenauthorised. I did not think that the amount sought by the Trustees with respect to their remuneration was reasonable. \"duplicativeor otherwise not necessary\" (CB 2675 at [16-18], 2676)5.\"I do note that the Trustee's costs with respect to the motion have not been assessed. I also consider that some of these costs may not be reasonable or may be excessive\"CCB 2684) at [54].6. SeeTonnassubmissions at hearing before Justice Hammerschlag on 1 Feb. 2023(exhibit V to my affidavit sworn on 22 April 2024).Dr Mendonca thensubmittedthat the remaining apportionment issues did not require consideration because the costs dispute concerning my orders on 6 December 2021 wasthe largest issue to be considered in the proceedings. On this premise, Dr Mendonca suggested that had theTonnas’concession on who should pay the Trustees’costs of attending the 6 December 2021 hearing been given earlier, Day 2 of the proceedings may have become unnecessary.Dr Mendonca seeks to characterise the positions she adopted throughout the proceedings as concessions and not a capitulation. She describes her conduct as reasonable and an approach whichresulted insignificant costs savings for all parties. Dr Mendonca instead claims thattheTonnascapitulated in relation to the issues of land tax, insurance and mortgage rent payments. In contrast, she contends that she was successful in the proceedings as, pursuant to prayer 4ofher summons, shehad achieveda significant reduction in the costs she owed to the Trustees by virtue of theTonnasbeing required to pay theircosts of the 6 December 2021 proceedings. Dr Mendonca contends all of herotherclaims which wereabandoned in the Negligence Proceedingswere claimsfor whichshe had evidence,butaboutwhich she made reasonable concessions. As a result of there being no hearing on the merits of these claims, Dr Mendoncasubmitted that the principlesinRe Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; ExparteLai Qin(1997) 186 CLR 622; [1997] HCA 6appliedso that thereshould be no order as to costs.Dr Mendoncaalso submitsthat she should not have to pay the Trustees’costs of the various proceedings on the indemnity basis becausetheTonnasalso challenged the Trustees’remuneration. Dr Mendonca claims that otherwise there was no determination on the merits of any of the proceedings and that as a result there should be no order as to costs, consistent withLai Qin. She also rejects that none of her claims were without merit. Shesubmits that she did have evidence to support her claims, but they were simply not heard on the merits.Finally,Dr Mendonca also rejects the Trustees’request for a gross sum costs order by stating that such an order would be unjust or unreasonable, albeit the basis for this contention is notclear from her submissions. She instead submits that there should be a 20% discount applied to the costs the Trustees seek. She also disagrees with the apportionment suggested by the Trustees (see [75] above)because she submits it isinconsistent with the order that all of the proceedingswere to beheard together.Negligence Proceedings– procedural historyTheseproceedingswerecommenced by Dr Mendoncainitially against the Trusteesbysummons filed on 5 September 2022. On 11 October 2022, Dr Mendonca then filed anotice ofmotion seeking the following relief,which wasto substantially the same effect ashersummons:1.

On that occasion, Registrar Walton required Dr Mendonca to file and serve astatement ofclaim joining Mr & Mrs Tonna asdefendantsin addition to the Trustees. On 20 April 2023, Dr Mendonca filed herstatement ofclaim joining theTonnasas theseconddefendants.

Costs of, and incidental to, these proceedings and such further orders as Court sees fit.On 29 May 2023, the Trustees filed their defence. Paragraph 19 of that defence denied thatDr Mendoncawas entitled to any of the relief claimed, or any other relief as against the Trustees. On 7 June 2023, Registrar Walton made orders extending the time fortheTonnasto file their defence and ordered that the parties attend a court-annexed mediation. On 15 June 2023,theTonnasfiled their defence denying the allegations against them,includingthat their conduct caused the costs of the sale process to increase and denied that they were unable or unwilling to complete. They also deniedthat the loan they received to be able to complete was invalid or void at law. The parties attended a court-annexed mediation on 28 July 2023 but were unable to settle the matter.These proceedings then came before me on 28 September 2023 for pre-trial directions after being set down for hearing for three days from 2 April 2024 by Registrar Walton on 14 August 2023. On that occasion I directedDr Mendoncato serve and file by email to my Associate a full outline of submissions in support of her case including identifying what affidavits and other materialssheproposedto rely upon at hearing in support of her case. Further directions relating to the filing and serving of evidence were made on 24 October 2023.On 29 January 2024, Dr Mendonca filed anotice ofmotion seeking leave to file and serve an amended statement of claim as well as anamendednotice ofmotion.I gaveDr Mendonca leave to file and serve anamendedstatement ofclaim in the form whichwas Annexure A to her affidavit sworn on 27 January 2024 and to pay theother parties’costs thrown away by theamendment. I also precluded Dr Mendonca from seeking to rely on any further evidence served after 12 February 2024 without leave of the Court. Thedefendants were to file any defences to theamendedstatement ofclaim by 15 March 2024. Dr Mendonca’s and theTonnas’expert accountants were also to attend a conclave and produce a joint expert’s report by 15 March 2024.Dr Mendonca filed heramendedstatement ofclaim (ASC) on 19 February 2024. The only substantial differences in the relief sought between theASC and the original pleadingwere to paragraphs 6 and 9 (amendments underlined).[6] Declaration or ordermaking findingsunders133 NCCP Act 2009 andsection 7 and/or section 8 and/or section 9 and /or section 12 and/or section 20 and set off under sch 1B ofContracts Review Act1980in relation to the loan contract and/or contract of sale.….[9] Order to dispense with rules under Section 14 of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW) where necessary in the interest of justice.Order that trustees to pay trust estate damages sustained from 4 July 2021 to 21 December 2021 as a result of failure of the trustees to demand from theTonnasan occupation fee or equitable compensation of $900 each week for theTonnasto live and do business and $300 each week for use of the large shed to be deduced fromTonnasshare of sale proceeds. In the alternative, orderTonnasto pay occupation fee or rent or mesne profits or equitable compensation of $900 each week to live and do business in thePropertyand $300 each week for use of the large shed as a deduction fromTonnasshare of sale proceeds, in equity.Those allegations were particularised at [O] and [P] of the Amended Statement of ClaimO. From 4 June 2021 until at least 21 December 2021 losses and damages to the trust estate was sustained as a result of failure of the trustees to comply with their duty to consult and give due consideration to whetherTonnasshould continue in occupation and, if so, on what terms and in the discharge of that duty find that that it was in the general interest of the trust to follow my wishes(ifconsulted) that following their appointment,Tonnashad no right of occupation, and thus it was open to them to demand possession fromTonnasor demand an occupation fee of $900 each week to live in and do business on property and $300 per week for use of large shed to be deducted fromTonnasshare of sale proceeds (without further notice) ifTonnasdid not make their decision to give vacant possession (excluding tenant) and the trustees and in permittingTonnasto continue in occupation free of charge, in excluding or restricting me from enjoying access to the property and shed and garage breached their duty of impartiality. In the alternative, occupation fee or rent or mesne profits or equitable compensation of $900 each week to live in and do business on property and$300 each week for use of large shed be deducted fromTonnasshare of sale proceeds in equity,Tonnashaving had the benefit of legal advice.P.From about 19 July 2021, losses and damages to the trust estate were sustained as a result of trustees failing to give instructions to employees to inform trustees when $20,000 was incurred, to avoid being replaced and by failing to give instructions to employees to comply with duties under section 66H ofConveyancingAct 1919and general law at all times. Trustees failed to comply with their duty to give due consideration to whether $20,000 has been incurred and, if so. whether to seek consent ofTonnasand myself and leave of court about 19 July 2021 and in the discharge of that duty find that consent ofTonnasand myself and leave of court must be sought or in its absence voluntarily resign or being removed and replaced by cheaper fixed fees solicitor and fixed fees real estate agent as trustees to comply with duty tosavesubstantial costs of trust.The Trusteesfiled theirdefence to theASCon 15 March 2024(theTonnasdefence was filed in Court on the first day of the hearing). In relation to the new allegations the Trustees denied that they owed a duty as set out in paragraphs [O] and [P] of the ASC, denied that they excluded or restrictedDr Mendoncafrom enjoying access to theproperty, denied having any information which suggested thattheTonnaslived on thepropertyand otherwise denied the further allegations.On 22 March 2024,MrSaliba, who providedtheTonnaswiththe loan which enabled them to complete thepurchase of thepropertyand whichloanDr Mendonca alleged was void, filed anotice ofmotion.Hesought orders to setaside subpoenas issued by Dr Mendonca tohimboth for documents and that he give evidence.I dealt with Mr Saliba’s motion on the first day of the hearing on2 April 2024.Mr J Brook of Counsel appeared for Mr Saliba. Mr Brook informed theCourt that the only document caught by the subpoena,beingthe Mortgage Loan Agreement dated 21 December 2021 entered into betweenMrSaliba and theTonnas, had been produced.It became clear that Dr Mendonca issued the subpoena to Mr Saliba because she wanted to call him in supportof herclaim thatthe loan agreement between Mr Saliba andtheTonnaswas voidon the grounds of illegality by reference to provisions of theContracts Review Act 1980(NSW) and theNational Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009(Cth). Whilst she initially wanted to cross-examineMr Saliba,after it was explained that he would be her witness, she said she would callhim in her case in chief.After hearingargument, I set aside the subpoena requiring Mr Saliba to attend to give evidence filed on 20 February 2024,and a further subpoena filed on 4 March 2024 insofar as it also required Mr Saliba to attend to give evidence. Thereasonfor the order wasDr Mendonca’s lackof standing to seek relief in relation toa loan agreement to which she was not a party.The Trustees, who were charged with the sale of thePropertypursuant to orders of this Court,hadaccepted the highest bid, which came from theTonnas. The transaction hadsettled. The funds which were to be paid under the loan agreement hadbeen paid and Mr Saliba now helda registered mortgage over theproperty. The personswithstanding to make any complaintsabout those arrangementsweretheTonnasnot Dr Mendonca.I therefore concluded thatthe subpoenas lacked a legitimate forensic purpose.At the start of the hearing Ialsoasked Dr Mendonca to specify what evidence she was relying on in these proceedings. The following exchange took place in which Dr Mendonca confirmed that she only pressed prayer4of the ASC which sought a“declaration that substantial trustees fees and disbursements be reduced from trustees fees and disbursements or be borne wholly byTonnasor shared by trustees andTonnas”(Tscpt2 April 2024, pp 38(25)-39(15)):PLAINTIFF: Your Honour, I'm only wishing for‑in the point number 4, that the substantial trustee fees and disbursements be reduced from trustees' fees and disbursements be fully borne by theTonnas, so the apportionment issue, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So that is the only relief that you are seeking in this document‑from this document now; is that correct?  Because this includes a claim for the trustees to pay moneys out and all sorts of things, so I just want to be very clear.  I'm looking at p 214.PLAINTIFF: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So the only claim‑just tell me if I'm right or wrong‑the only claim that you now press in this amended statement of claim is what we're referring to as the apportionment issue, which is set out, you say, in para 4; is that correct?PLAINTIFF: I say that the substantial trustee fees and disbursements be reduced‑be‑sorry, be borne wholly by theTonnas, or‑that‑yes, the substantial trustee fees and disbursements be borne wholly by theTonnas.HIS HONOUR: All right.PLAINTIFF: I'm not wishing it for‑‑HIS HONOUR: The trustees?PLAINTIFF: Yeah.HIS HONOUR: So, to be clear, what we have been referring to as the negligence claim, you are no longer pressing?  That is, you are not seeking these amounts of 48,000, 100,000 that you were telling me about this morning, to be set off from what the trustees are entitled to?PLAINTIFF: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Again, just to make sure I'm following what you're saying, Dr Mendonca, the only issue that you want me to decide in your amended statement of claim is whether or not there should be some apportionment between you and theTonnas, in effect, that it goes to theTonnasof the fees that we now agree should be paid to the trustees?PLAINTIFF: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All rightOnce again, for the avoidance of doubt, Dr Mendonca accepted that she no longer disputed that the Trustees were entitled to $192,000 for their fees. The dispute only concerned the proportions in which that amount should be paid between Dr Mendonca andtheTonnas(Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p.39(44-47).The position adoptedby Dr Mendoncadiffered from the relief sought inprayer 4 of her ASC. Dr Mendonca now contended that theTonnasshould not pay the entirety of the $192,000 owed to the Trustees. Instead, she submitted thateach party should pay the initial estimate of Trustees feesreferred to inDarke J’s orders, being $20,000, in the proportions oftheir Interests. Shecontended thatthe remaining $172,000 should be borne entirely bytheTonnas(Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p. 40 (15-26). IaskedDr Mendoncatogo through thereferee’s reportduring an extended luncheon adjournmentand specify which costs shesaidshould be borne by theTonnasand why.She did so.In light of Dr Mendonca only pressingprayer4 of herASC, there was no substantive relief sought against the Trustees.I thereforedismissed the claim as against the Trustees subject to reserving their right to seek their costsofthese proceedings against Dr Mendonca. It also became clear that Dr Mendonca’s 11 October 2022notice of motion(see [94] above), had yet to be formally dealt with. To avoid confusion with herASCI dismissed that motion on 2 April 2024 and ordered that the parties’costs of that notice of motion be their costs inthe Negligence Proceedings.The outstanding issue between Dr Mendonca andtheTonnasin these proceedings concerned whichfees and costsshould be borne by theTonnaspersonally and which costs should be borne bythebeneficiaries in proportionto their Interests.The first feesin dispute were the coststhe Trustees incurred obtaining expert reports to determine whether a large shed on theproperty, which theTonnaswere using to run their business, was a fixture (as contended by Dr Mendonca) or a chattel as contended by theTonnas. Dr Mendonca submitted that cost should be borne by theTonnasas they were the protagonistsin this dispute andhadeventually conceded the shed was a fixture.The second disputed payment was whether theTonnasshould pay the costs the Trustees incurred with respect to engaging with the tenants occupying thepropertyprior toitgoing to auction. Dr Mendonca said that she wanted thetenantstovacatethepropertyas soon as possible but theTonnashadindicated that they were willing to allow thetenants to stay in thepropertyuntilsome timeuntil 2022.The third disputed payment related to some of the costs the Trustees incurred by engaging LJ Hooker as the selling agent for theproperty. Dr Mendoncacontendedthat some of the costs incurred in relation to allowing potential purchasers to enter and view thepropertyshould be borne by theTonnasbecausethey did not allow Dr Mendonca to view theProperty. How liability for that should be apportioned was not made clear in her submissions or during the course ofthe hearing.The fourth disputed payment was whether Dr Mendonca should be required to pay the costs the Trustees charged in relation to their personal attendance at the hearing before me on 6 December 2021 concerning theTonnas’unsuccessful motion. Dr Mendonca claimed she should not bevisitedwith that cost given that motion was unsuccessfully brought bytheTonnasand those costs would otherwise not have been incurred.The fifth disputed cost is the costs the Trustees incurred having to address a garnishee orderobtainedbytheTonnas(the garnished amount being the subject of theInterpleader Proceedings). Dr Mendonca submittedit was unreasonablefortheTonnasto seek thegarnishee orderbecausethere was no moneyavailableat the time, therefore theorderwas premature and the application should not have been made.The final dispute concerned whether there should be a set off from what Dr Mendonca owedto the Trustees of rent repayments which were received bytheTonnasandwhich Dr Mendoncasaidshould have gone to her. Dr Mendoncasubmittedthat between thejudgment of Ward CJ in Eqon 19 December 2019, which stated that Dr Mendonca was a co-owner of theproperty, to the point that theTrustees were appointed on 4 June 2021,she was entitled to rent in theproportion of her Interest. Dr Mendonca pressedforthe payment of that rent to her by theTonnasby effectively setting-off that amount from the amount she owedthe Trustees.On the second day of the hearing, Mr Stewart cross-examined Dr Mendoncaabout the payments which were still in dispute,andwhich I have listed in the preceding paragraphs.Afterthe luncheon adjournment on the second day,Mr StewartindicatedthattheTonnasaccepted theywere required to pay Dr Mendonca $63,000 for rental payments,and thattheyaccepted that amounts ina particular accountant’s reportwere accurate (Tscpt, 3 April 2024, p. 114(26)-115(4)).Late in the afternoon onthe second day, having abandoned her claim in theInterpleader Proceedings(see [140] below),Dr Mendonca said that she would be content with all of thedisputedpayments being paid in accordance with the parties’Interestson the basisof the indications Mr Stewart had given on behalf of theTonnasrecorded in the preceding paragraph(seeTscpt, 3 April 2024, p. 128(10)-130(14)).This meant that the remainingset off issues fell away. Theparties therefore agreed thatDr Mendonca’sASCshould be dismissed.It was accepted by theTonnasthattheywere required to pay $17,000 pursuant toa costsorder I made on 6 December 2021, in relation to their unsuccessful motionfiledon 3 December 2021. Subject to theTonnasaccepting they were required to pay this amount, Dr Mendonca and theTonnasreached the position that they should be responsible fortheassessedlegal fees of the Trusteesin accordance with their Interests.The end result was thaton 3 April 2024, at the conclusion of the hearing,I madethe following orders in relation to these proceedings:3. An order that the Notice of Motion filed by Dr Mendonca on 11 October 2022 be dismissed, with the parties’ costs of that motion to be their costs of Proceedings 2022/264829.4. An order that the Amended Statement of Claim filed by Dr Mendonca on 19 January 2024 (ASOC), be dismissed.The Negligence Proceedings – theTonna’s submissions as to costsTheTonnassubmit that Dr Mendonca should pay their costs on the indemnity basis. They submit that herASCandnotice ofmotion dated 11 October 2022,bothbeing dismissed on 3 April2024with an order that the costs of the motionwere to bethe parties’costs in the proceedings,meansthat Dr Mendonca is the unsuccessful party in these proceedings. As costs follow the event, Dr Mendonca should be required to paytheTonnas’costs.In support of the proposition that costs should be paid on the indemnity basis,theTonnassubmit that Dr Mendonca effectively abandoned all butprayer4 of herASCwhich sought that theTrustees’substantial fees and disbursements be wholly borne bytheTonnas.This meant that [A] to [J] and the firsttenand a half lines of [K], [L]. [M], [N] and [P] of herASCwere all abandoned. TheTonnassought to highlight the severity of the matters which had been dismissed. [A]-[D] of her ASC raised alleged breaches of dutybased on the premise that the Trustees were required to consult Dr Mendonca pursuant to s 66H on various matters related to the sale, and had they done so she would have‘got a better deal’on solicitor and real estate agents costs. [E]-[N] alleged that the loan theTonnasobtained to complete the contract was void for illegality and that the Trustees incurred unnecessary costs by extending the opportunity the Trustees had to complete the contract using‘crime loan proceeds’. Mr Stewart also noted that Dr Mendonca even sought to subpoena Mr Saliba to establish whether thecontract for salewas void for illegality. [O] challenged whether theTonnashad a right to occupy thepropertyat the time of sale and whether that occupation caused unnecessary costs to the Trustees.Finally,[P] contended that the Trustees‘failed to comply with their duty to give due consideration to whether $20,000 has been incurred’. This was said to be unreasonable in light of the ruling by Hammerschlag CJ Eq at [22] above, that the effect of Darke J’s orders on 4 June 2021 was not to cap the costs the Trustees could incur to $20,000.It was submitted that the unreasonableness ofherconductwas exacerbated in circumstances where Dr Mendonca was apparently baselessly challenging the indefeasible titleoftheTonnasto the propertyfrom 21 December 2021, yet concurrently was content to otherwise receive 71.13% of the proceeds.In summary, it was said that Dr Mendonca hadabandoned serious allegations that the Trusteeshadpreferred theTonnas’interests over Dr Mendonca’s interests, that Dr Mendonca was denied procedural fairness, allegations as to illegal loans and“crime loan”proceeds being used by theTonnasto purchase thepropertyand breaches of various legislative provisions.As a result of the concessions made by Dr Mendonca, the only issue remaining in dispute related to prayer 4 of the relief which sought a‘declaration that trustees fees and disbursementsorbe borne wholly byTonnasor shared by Trustees &Tonnas.’Insofar as Dr Mendonca maintained prayer 4 of the ASC,Mr Stewart’s submissions outlined the precise amounts of costs which Dr Mendonca sought for theTonnasto bear personally:By the middle of Day 2, it wasonlythe amended Prayer 4 declaration that was sought by Dr Mendonca and the allegations she still persisted with were as follows:a.Paragraph [K] of the ASOC as to Mark and Lorraine Tonna causing the Trustees' remuneration to be increased in relation to:i.a large shed - she sought theTonnasto solely pay, on their calculation, the sum of$12,283.00;ii. the 'void' tenancy agreement - LJ Hooker - as to 50/50 so $28,884 to be paid by theTonnasand Dr Mendonca each;soa 'dollar' change fromthe co-owner proportions for theTonnas, on their calculation, of an additional sum of $12,205.94;iii. the property entry issues - an unspecifiedamount;iv. what were described as set off issues before Kunc J - Dr Mendonca sought that theTonnaspay $63,037.00; and/orv. garnishee issues, although she was not able to articulate what this meant in dollar terms because it was a part of (iv) above.b. The monetary claims by Dr Mendoncavis a visthe Trustees' legal costs (Breene & Breene) for each of these was:i.The Shed- that theTonnaspay$3,720.00;ii. Set off \"dispute determined by Kunc J\" - that theTonnaspay$21,667.00;iii. Conveyancing, tenancy and deposit issues as to 50/50 so: $17,263.00 payable by theTonnasand then they also pay 28.87% of $17,263;soan additional $4,983.83.iv. Garnishee order - that theTonnaspay the sum of $2,755.00.It wassubmittedthat the size of Dr Mendonca’s claim was minimal relative to the size of the claims which regularly appear before this Court. It was also said to be incommensurate with the extent of costs and time which had been incurred to prepare an 8 volume court book, have scheduled a three-day hearing and required Dr Mendonca to undergo a lengthy cross-examination. The unreasonableness of the costs and time incurred only becamemore starkwhen Dr Mendonca dropped all of her claims in these proceedings after her cross-examination.The Negligence Proceedings – theTrustees’submissionsas to costsThe Trustees primarily contend that they should obtain their costs on the indemnity basisfromDr Mendoncaand that they obtain these costs on a gross sum basis in the proportions set out at [75] above.It is submitted that Dr Mendonca capitulated in light of the Court dismissing the proceedings after Dr Mendonca informed the Court that she did not press her claims against the Trustees including allegations of breach of statutory duty and fiduciary obligations. The Trustees contend that the costs should follow the event, being the dismissal of the proceedings after Dr Mendonca’s concessions. They seek their costs on the indemnity basis on the premise that Dr Mendonca’s claims were unmeritorious and lacked any evidentiary basis.The same submissions in support of their application for a gross sum costs order (see [74]-[75]) are applicable to their application in these proceedings.The Negligence Proceedings– Dr Mendonca's submissions as to costsThese are set out in[78]to[93]above.TheInterpleader Proceedings - proceduralhistoryThese proceedings were commenced bysummons filed by the Trustees on 10 January 2022. The Trusteessought an order directing payment intoCourt of the principal sum of $505,382.64 together with interest thereon of $15,284.51 in answer toa garnishee order issued in favour of theTonnasin the DistrictCourt.The next development came on20 March2023,whenDr Mendonca filed anotice ofmotionfor these orders:1.

Any order the Court sees fit as applicant has no legal experience/is self-representedOn7 June 2023,Registrar Walton ordered any motions or amended applications and any evidence in supportto be filedby 19 June 2023 and referred the matter to a court-annexed mediation. That mediation occurred on28 July2023,but theproceedingsdid not settle.On 20June 2023, DrMendonca filed an amended notice of motion for these orders:1. An order to join Renuka Maria Mendonca as first defendant and Mark Julian Tonna as second defendant and Lorraine Mary Tonna as third defendant in 2022/7598 or leave to serve Mark and Lorraine Tonna with subpoena to attend final hearing.2.

Any order Court sees fit as applicant has no legal experience/is self-represented.On 27 June 2023,theTonnasfiled a Notice of Motion seeking the following orders:1. Pursuant to r 55.11 of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, that the sum of $520, 667.15 paid into Court by the First Respondent on or about 10 January 2022, plus any interest accruing in relation to that amount, be paid to the Second and Third Respondents.2. CostsAfter theunsuccessful mediation on 28 July 2023, thematter was set down before me for hearing from 2 April 2024 by Registrar Walton on 14 August 2023, Ialsocommenced case managing these proceedings. On 28 September 2023,I made directions for Dr Mendonca andtheTonnasto serve and file by email to myAssociate a document setting out the details of the matters in the report of Mr David Rosenthal(see [138] below)with which that party agreedand the matters with which that party disagreed. On 14 February 2024, I ordered that Dr Mendonca’s and theTonnas’experts attend a conclave and produce a joint expert’s report which identifiedthe areas on which the experts agreedand disagreed, and the reasons for any disagreement, with such report to be circulated to the parties and to be filed by the Trusteesby22 March 2024.Mr Rosenthal(whose report the parties referred to as theJudge Accountants Report)was anindependent accountant retainedby the parties to calculate the set-offsto which they were entitled in relation tothe proceeds of sale of theproperty. Mr Rosenthal’s report was intended to facilitate the parties complying withthe judgment ofWard CJ in Eqof25 March 2020 that the partiesproportionate shares of contributions paid towards thepropertybe set-off against each other. The payments the subject of the set-off include mortgage, rent and insurancepayments made by the parties.Despite her notice of motion initially suggesting she was disputing the conclusions of the Judge Accountants Report,at the hearingDr Mendoncasaidthat what shepressedfrom her motion was for theTonnasto be paid the difference between $520,000 and whatever the report suggested she was owed (Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p. 53(25)-(30)).Given her concession that the Judge AccountantsReportwasaccurate, and the concessions given in the related proceedings, Dr Mendonca agreed that heramendednotice ofmotion filed 20 June 2023 was redundant (Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p. 55(6)-(14)). The partiesagreedthat all they were arguing about was how thefundsshould be divided,which in substance was the dispute enlivened bytheTonnas’notice ofmotion filed 27 June 2023 (see [136] above).Against that background,I dismissedDr Mendonca’samended notice of motionwith the parties’costs of that amended notice of motion being their costs in the proceedings.Mr Stewart informed me that in relation to the Tonna motion, the only question remaining for me to determinewaswhat should the final figures from the Judge Accountants Report actually reflect? Mr Stewart foreshadowed that he had some new evidence which he wouldseekto put on in relation to that report.During the course of the hearing it became clear that Dr Mendonca’sconcernwas not with the amount of money that may be paid out and to whom, but rather that shesubmitted she wasowedmoney by theTonnasin respect ofleast one costs judgmentin her favour, if notalsoother amounts, whichshe saidshould besatisfied from the funds(Tscpt, 2 April 2024, p. 124 (15)).I delivered an ex-tempore judgmentduring the course of the hearing explaining why the Court would not accede to Dr Mendonca’s application.In that judgment I noted that Mr Stewart had drawn my attention to the fact that an even largerdebt is owed by Dr Mendonca totheTonnas, arising from costs ordersmade in the proceedings heard by Ward CJ in Eq.It became apparent thatthat there are a number of whatIcalledextraneous debts extant betweentheTonnasandDr Mendonca (in her own right or with her husband).I usedthe word \"extraneous\" to make the point that those debtsare unrelated to thesale orthe proceedsnow held by the Trustees on the statutory trusts.In my respectful view, itwasnot open to the Court to order adjustments or set offs unrelated to the property,theproceeds or the three matters which the Court was hearing.I was firmly of the view thatthe fundswere properly funds to whichtheTonnaswere entitled pursuant to the garnishee orders.Iwasnot satisfied that anything DrMendoncahadsaid or drawn to my attention would justify disrupting the ordinary course, namely that those fundsshouldbe paid out totheTonnas.Therefore,at the conclusion of the hearing I made the following orders in relation to these proceedings:…Proceedings 2022/75985 An order that the Amended Notice of Motion filed by Dr Mendonca on 20 June 2023 be dismissed, with the parties’costs of that motion to be their costs in proceedings 2022/7598.6 An order that pursuant to UCPR r 55.11 the sum of $520,667.15 paid into Court by the trustee parties on or about 20 January 2022 together with any accrued interest be paid to MJ and LM Tonna forthwith.6A These orders be entered forthwith.The Interpleader Proceedings – theTonnas’submissionsas to costsIn theInterpleaderProceedings,theTonnassubmit that Dr Mendonca should pay their costs on the ordinary basis.TheTonnascontend that they were ultimately the successful party on the motion which soughtthatthefunds bepaid to them.Therefore, costs should follow the event and Dr Mendonca should paytheTonnas’costs on the ordinary basis.The Interpleader Proceedings – theTrustees’submissionsas to costsConsistent with their position in theNegligence Proceedings, the Trusteessubmit their costs should bepaid on the indemnity basis by Dr Mendoncaand for a gross sum costs order (see[75]above).As to their primary position that Dr Mendonca should pay theircosts of theInterpleader Proceedingson the indemnitybasis, theTrustees submit that in substance Dr Mendonca was the unsuccessful party in these proceedings. Whilst the Trustees were the respondents to anotice ofmotion in these proceedings without any specific relief sought against them, the Trustees submit that Dr Mendonca effectively duplicated the relief sought in theNegligence Proceedings and sought that the motion be heard together with the other proceedings. Therefore, the Trustees submit that Dr Mendonca was also unsuccessful in these proceedings and should be required to pay the Trustees’costs in these proceedings as well.While theTonnasfiled a motion in theInterpleader Proceedings on27June 2023 tobe paid thefunds, the Trustees submitthat the costs incurred in these proceedings were all incurred in response to Dr Mendonca’s motion rather thanto theTonnas, because the Trustees did not oppose thefundsbeing paid out to theTonnas.Therefore, it is Dr MendoncaandnottheTonnasor theproceedswhich should bevisited with the costs of these proceedings.The Interpleader Proceedings -Dr Mendonca’ssubmissions as to costsDr Mendonca rejects that she should have to pay the Trustees’costs. She contends that the Trustees should have accepted the offer made by her solicitors at the time, Unsworth Legal, to use the liberty to apply to Darke J to resolve issues concerning the money sought in thegarnisheeorder, rather than commencetheseproceedings. Therefore,she contends that there should be no order as to costs.In response to theTonnas,Dr Mendonca alleges that theTonnasbreached the orders of Darke J made on 4 June 2021 by seeking a garnishee order againstthe Trustees for payment intoCourt of $505,284.52 instead of allowing the money to be held on trust until there was agreement as to the amountsto be distributed to the beneficiaries. Dr Mendonca says this conduct was especially unreasonable given the other costs ordersthat had been made in her favour.Finally, I record that the Trustees did not provide a formal response to Dr Mendonca’s submissions, choosing instead to rely on their initial submissions as to costs. The Trustees noted that Dr Mendonca had not sought to engage or respond directly with the Trustees’submissions regarding the costs of these proceedings.ConsiderationWhile for the sake of clarity, and to record Dr Mendonca’s conduct of the proceedings,I have set out above a detailed history of what occurred by reference to each of the three proceedings, the fact remains that they were case managed and heard together. Having regard to the Court’s broad discretion as to costs (as to which see further below), that fact is why the Court accepts Dr Mendonca’s submission that the question of costs should be resolvedby looking at the three sets of proceedings as a whole. However, whether it is viewed that way, or by reference to each proceeding, the result isthe same andnot favourable to Dr Mendonca for the reasons which follow.It is useful to begin with some general propositions:The Court has a broad discretion as to costs, confined only by the requirements that it be exercised judicially and for the purpose it was conferred (Oshlackv Richmond River Council(1998) 193 CLR 72, 96 (McHugh J); [1998] HCA 11).Generally, costs will follow the event: UCPR Pt 42 r42.1.Where the court has not made a determination as to the merits of thedispute, or in other words there is no event for which costs will follow,the general rule is that there be no order as to costs. However, costs can be awarded if a judge is confident that one party was almost certain to succeed or that another party acted so unreasonably that the other party should be able to obtain their costs:Re Minister for Immigration and EthnicAffairs of the Commonwealth of Australia; ExparteLai Qin(1997) 186 CLR 622,624-625(McHugh J); [1997] HCA 6.Costs may be awarded on the indemnity basiswhere a party has commenced or continued proceedings when, properly advised, they should have known they had no chance of success:Fountain Selected Meats(Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Ltd(1988) 81 ALR 397, 401 (Woodward J); [1998] FCA364.A trustee is entitled to a complete indemnity from the trust estate for all costs and expenses properly incurred with the execution and administration of the trust:Trustee Act 1925(NSW) ss 59(4) and 93.The indemnity must be given effect to in such a way as to make the burden fall upon the beneficiaries equitably having regard to the circumstances under which the costs, charges and expenses were incurred:National Trustees Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Ltd v Barnes(1941) 64 CLR 268, 279 (Williams J);[1941] HCA 3.Turning to the three casesat bar, theCourt’s conclusions set out below rest on two basic considerations.First, the Court accepts that the Trustees have not engaged in any conduct which would displace the outcome referred to in [154(5)]above.Second, thelengthyhistory recounted over the preceding pages warrants the conclusion, which the Courtreadilydraws, that three days of Court time were set aside and a court book of 8 volumes was produced to deal with what were complaints and challengespressedby Dr Mendonca.However Dr Mendonca mayattempt tocharacterise what occurred, the events as they unfolded beforemeat the hearingwere a gradual capitulation and abandonment by Dr Mendonca of each of her substantive complaints and challenges.In particular, I do not accept that the resolution of any debate about theTonnas’costs obligations under the Kunc J judgment was the decisive watershed that Dr Mendonca contends.During the course of the hearing, as it became necessary for her to identify the evidence and specific arguments in support of her particular contentions, she chose not to press them.By the end, it was a completecapitulation.Both by reason of that capitulation and thenature of thematters she had sought to raise, the Court concludes that her various contentions and objections had been unreasonably maintained by her.The Court also accepts theTonnas’specific submissions at[53]to[59]and[121]to[128]above as to Dr Mendonca’s unreasonableprosecution of the proceedings.As tothematters she sought to advance, the Court also concludes that, properly advised, Dr Mendonca should have known that her various contentions and objections had no chance of success.In reaching that conclusion, I have not overlooked the reduction of the Trustee’s remuneration determined by the referee’s report, but on any view Dr Mendonca was pressing for a far greater reductionthan 13.3%.By reason of theconclusions set out in this paragraph, the Court does not accept Dr Mendonca’s submissions set outaboveat [78] and followingand[150]to[151]including her reliance onLai Qinfor the proposition that there should,to any extent,be no order as to costs.Before turning to specific orders in each proceeding, it is convenient to deal first with the issue of who should bear the burden of the Trustees’remuneration and expensesother than legal costsand the application of the principle set out in [154(6)] above.For example, theTonnassubmit that the Trustees’remuneration and expenses of the Remuneration Proceedings should be borne by Dr Mendonca. The Trusteessubmit these should be deducted from theProceedswithout apportionment. This would mean in practical terms that they would be borne by Dr Mendonca and theTonnasin their respectiveInterests.Because of Dr Mendonca’s conduct referred to in[157]and[158]above,in my respectful opinionthat isnot ajust outcome, whether in relation to the Remuneration Proceedings or more generally.It must be recognised that some of theTrustees’remuneration and expenses would have been incurred even without Dr Mendonca’s interventions,and the Court is not in a position to perform any kind of precisedissection of what they might be.Nevertheless, that does not mean the Court should not do the best it canto achieve a fair result, especially in the interests of bringing finality to the parties.To that end, I have concluded that the relevant starting point for any adjustment should be after theunsuccessfulmediation on28 July2023. This resulted in the proceedings being fixed before me for management and hearing. As to the division between Dr Mendonca and theTonnas, my impressionderived from my involvementis that requiringDr Mendonca to meet halftheremunerationand non-legal expensesof the Trustees after that date would be both fair and conservative, given that thevarious controversies wereessentially driven by her.Accordingly, the Court will direct that the Trustees’approved remuneration and expenses(other than legal costs)incurred in all three matters and generally are to bepaidas follows:Incurred for the period up to and including28 July2023 from theproceedswithout apportionment between Dr Mendonca and theTonnas;Incurred for the periodon and from28 July2023uptoand including3 April 2024from the proceedsas to 50%without apportionment between Dr Mendonca and theTonnas;Incurred for the periodon and from28 July2023uptoand including3 April 2024from theproceedsas tothe other50%to be paid out of what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceeds.I will next turn to thelegalcostsin each ofthethree proceedings.In relation to theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings:Subject to the next sub-paragraph,there should be an order in terms of that sought by the Trustees in [67] above. Given the history of disputation between the parties, this should include the gross sum costs orderfor$82,000sought by the Trustees, which the Court is satisfied on the evidence is appropriate both as to quantum and the apportionment between the respective proceedings. Consistently with their right of complete indemnification, the Trustees should also have an order for interest on the costs incurred by them.In a more usual case, the costs referred to in the preceding paragraph would be paid to the Trustees before any apportionment to the beneficiaries, such that in effect they would be borne by the beneficiaries in their respective ultimate shares. However, the Court acceptsin parttheTonnas’submission that they should not be visited with the Trustees’costs.I say in part because that result should apply insofar as those costs may be attributed to Dr Mendonca’sunreasonableconduct.Accordingly, and consistently with the approach I have taken in [161] above, the Trustees’costsfor the period on and from28 July2023 up to and including 3 April 2024 which are referred to in the preceding sub-paragraph should becharged onwhat would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceeds.For the reasons advanced by theTonnasin[49]to[66]above, Dr Mendonca should pay theTonnas’costs of theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings. This should be on the ordinary basis up to and including28 July2023 and thereafter on the indemnity basis by reason ofDr Mendonca’sconductas found in [157]and[158]above, applying the principle in [154(4)] above.They should be charged on what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share ofthe proceedsbut ranking after the Trustees.As to the Negligence Proceedings, by reason of the conclusionsset out in[157]and[158]above:And accepting the Trustees’submissions in[129]to[130]above, Dr Mendonca should pay the Trustees’costs of the Negligence Proceedings on the indemnity basisassessed in the gross sum of$112,750.00together with interest on costs incurred. Conformably with my decision in relation to theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings, theTonnasshould bear no part ofthe Trustees’costs insofar as the Trustees’right of indemnity is concernedand the costs should be charged on what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceeds.And accepting the Tonna’s submissions in[120]to[128]above, Dr Mendonca should pay the Tonna’s costs of the Negligence Proceedings on the indemnity basis, those costs tobe charged on what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceedsbut ranking after the Trustees.Asto the Interpleader Proceedings:And accepting the Trustees’submissions in[147]to[149]above, Dr Mendonca should pay the Trustees’costs of the Interpleader Proceedings on the indemnity basis assessed in the gross sum of$10, 250.00together with interest on costs incurred. Conformably with my decision in relation to theTrustee Remuneration Proceedings, theTonnasshould bear no part of the Trustees’costs insofar as the Trustees’right of indemnity is concerned and the costs should be charged on what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceeds.And accepting the Tonna’s submissions in[146]above, Dr Mendonca should pay the Tonna’s costs of the Interpleader Proceedings on theordinary basis, those costs tobe charged on what would otherwise be Dr Mendonca’s net share of theproceedsbut ranking after the Trustees.CONCLUSIONThe Court will make directions for the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to these reasons, with the Trustees to prepare afirstdraft for the consideration of the other parties.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Principal Officer, Adoptions, forBarnardosAustralia,soughtthe following orders:That pursuant toStatus of Children Act 1996(NSW), s 21(2),“Tim”(not his real name)is the father ofGeorgia.That pursuant toBirths, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995(NSW), s 19(2),orders be madefor the inclusion ofTimas the father ofGeorgiain the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages.That pursuant toAdoption Act 2000(NSW), s 67(1)(d), the requirement for the consents of the birth mother,who I will call“Belinda”(not her real name), and the birth father,Tim, be dispensed with.Orders pursuant toAdoption Act 2000(NSW), s 23, for the adoption ofThomasandGeorgiain favour of the adoption parents,who I will call“Laura”(not her real name)and“Craig”(not his real name).That pursuant toAdoption Act 2000(NSW), s 101(1), the Court approvesnew surnames for Thomas and Georgia;That pursuant toAdoption Act 2000(NSW), ss 50(1) and 50(3), theAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan andAmendedPaternal Adoption Plan be registered.That pursuant toAdoption Act 2000(NSW), leave be granted to provide copies of theAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan toBelinda, the maternal grandfather, and the maternal aunt, and copies of theAmendedPaternal Adoption Plan toTimand the paternal grandmother.ThomasandGeorgia’s mother,Belinda, filed a Notice of Appearance and was joined as theseconddefendant in these proceedings on 5 July 2023.ThomasandGeorgia’s father,Tim,is registered onThomas’s birthcertificate butis not registered onGeorgia’s birth certificate.Heisthe firstdefendantin these proceedings.He is currently serving a term of imprisonment and participated in these proceedings via AVLOn 30 July 2024,I made the adoption orders sought andindicated that I wouldgivereasons later.Theseare my reasons.The circumstances I describe below reflect the commitment that everyone involved in these proceedings has shown to promoting the best interests of these children.The circumstancesThomasandGeorgiawere removed from the care ofBelindaandTiminJuly 2020andplaced intoaBarnardosTemporary Foster Care(“TFC”)arrangement.Thomaswas then 2 years of age andGeorgiawas one year of age.From November 2020,LauraandCraigprovidedweekend respitecare toThomasandGeorgiato support theirTFC carer at that time.InSeptember 2021, the Children’s Court at Port Kembla made orders allocating parental responsibility for the children to the Minister for Families and Communities until they each reached18 years of age pursuant to theChildren and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998(NSW) (“Care Act”).The children were identified as requiring a long-term placement together that could provide them with a stable and secure environment, with dually authorised carers who had a sound understanding of the impact of trauma on child development and were committed to facilitating birth family visits.LauraandCraigwere selected as appropriate carers due to their established and familiar relationship with the children as weekend respite carers.Following theformalmatching process,ThomasandGeorgiacame intoLauraandCraig’s careinNovember 2021.Thomaswasthen3 years of age, andGeorgiawas 2 years of age.They have lived withLauraandCraigcontinuously since that time.InMay 2023, the Secretarycommenced proceedingsin thisCourt seeking adoption orders for the children in favour ofLauraandCraig.InSeptember 2023,Belindafiled in the Children’s Court an applicationpursuant to s 90 of the Care Actseekingrescission of the final orders madeinSeptember 2021 andallocation ofparental responsibility for the children to her,to the exclusion ofTim.TheSecretaryopposedBelinda’sapplication.InOctober 2023,Belinda,Laura,Craig,andthe Department of Communities and Justice andBarnardoscasework teamsparticipated in a mediation facilitated by Legal Aid NSW.InNovember 2023, the parties attended a preliminary hearing before me.Belindaappeared via telephone link, andTimappearedviaAVL from South Coast Correctional Centre.At that occasion,Belinda,Tim,Laura, andCraigwereeachgivenan opportunity to speak to me and to each other about what theybelieved to bethe best course forward forThomasandGeorgia.InFebruary 2024,Belindawithdrew her s 90 applicationin the Children’s Court.At the next directions hearing in this Court,Belindaindicated,with the assistance of the Legal AidNSWduty solicitor,that sherequiredfurther time to consider her position in respect of these adoption proceedings.InMarch 2024, a solicitor from Legal AidNSWassistingBelindainformed the Crown Solicitor’s Office thatBelindawould oppose the adoption order being made on the basis that the contactproposedin theAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan is inadequate anddid not in her viewpromote the children’s best interests.ThomasandGeorgiahave one maternal half-sibling,Ava (not her real name), and three paternal half-siblings.Avaremains inBelinda’s care. The paternal half-siblings reside with their mother.Georgia’s parentageI will deal firstwithGeorgia’s parentage.The Secretary seeks an order thatTimbe declared asGeorgia’s father. As I have said above,Georgia’s birth certificate does not name her father.The Secretary isa nominated personauthorised to bring an application for a declaration of parentage.[1]On any such application, the Court may make a declaration that a named or identified person is a child’s parent.[2]The Secretary relied on s 10 of theStatus of Children Actto give rise toa rebuttablepresumption of parentage,relevantly that a child born to a woman is presumed tobea man’s child if, at any time during the period not earlier than 44 weeks and ending not less than 20 weeks before the birth, the man and the woman cohabit but are not married.The evidence points to the likelihood that theBelindaandTimwere cohabitingin the relevant period.Iwassatisfied thatGeorgia’spaternity is proven on the balance of probabilitieson the evidence before me.First,Timconsiders himself to beGeorgia’s father, and has consistently identified himself asGeorgia’s father during dealings with the Department of Communities and Justice andBarnardos.Indeed, at the preliminary hearingbefore meinNovember 2023,Timstated in reference toGeorgia,“Yeah, she’s my daughter, 100%, like there’s no doubt about it”.Second,Belindahas consistently identifiedTimasGeorgia’s father, including in her Affidavit filed 18 July 2024.Third,DNA testing resultshaveindicated that a full sibling relationship betweenThomasandGeorgiais“practically proven”.I wasalsosatisfied that itis inGeorgia’sbest interests that a declaration of parentage be made thatTimis her father. The inclusion ofTim’s name on her birth certificate will support her ongoing relationship with her birthfather andsupport her understanding of her identity as she grows up.Itwillalso enableGeorgiato access informationaboutTimin due course, if she so wishes, pursuant to the information provisions contained in theAdoption Act.[3]Thus, I made the declarationpursuant to s 21(2) of theStatus of Children ActthatTimis the father ofGeorgia. In accordance with my finding,I made an orderpursuant to s 19(2) of theBirths, Deaths and Marriages Registration Actthat the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages includeTimas the father ofGeorgiain the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages.Orders for adoptionI will now deal with the orders sought by the Secretary in relation to the adoption ofThomasandGeorgia.The formal requirements for adoptionI was satisfied that theformal requirements of theAdoption Acthave been satisfied,namely:the children were present in New South Wales when the proceedings were commenced;[4]LauraandCraigwere resident and domiciled in New South Wales when the proceedings were commenced;[5]LauraandCraigare of good repute and are fit and proper persons to fulfill the responsibility of parents;[6]LauraandCraighave been selected in accordance with theAdoption Act;[7]LauraandCraigsatisfy the age andlength of relationshiprequirements.[8]Whether adoption is in the best interests of the childAdoption is to be regarded as a service for the children,[9]and not as a right of the adults with whom they are placed.[10]The paramount consideration in an application for adoption is the best interests of the childor, in this case, the childrenthe subject of the application.Iamnot ablemake an adoption order unless satisfied that the best interests ofThomasandGeorgiawouldbe promoted by the adoption and that, as far as practicable and having regard toherage and understanding,ThomasandGeorgia’swishes and feelings hadbeen ascertained and due consideration given to them.[11]Imust have regard to the best interests ofThomasandGeorgia, both in childhood and later life.[12]When consideringThomasandGeorgia’s best interests, I had regard to the matters set forth in s 8(2) of theAdoption Act,relevantly:ThomasandGeorgia’s respectiveages, maturity, levelsof understanding, gender, background and family relationships and any other characteristics of the childrenthatIconsiderrelevant;[13]ThomasandGeorgia’s physical, emotional and educational needs, including their sense of personal, family and cultural identity;[14]LauraandCraig’s attitudesto the children and to the responsibilities of parenthood;[15]the nature of the relationship thatThomasandGeorgiahave with each ofLauraandCraig;[16]the suitability and capacity of each ofLauraandCraigto provide forThomasandGeorgia’s needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs;[17]andthe need to protectThomasandGeorgiafrom physical or psychological harm caused, or that may be caused, by being subjected or exposed to abuse, ill-treatment, violence or other behaviour, or being present while a third person is subjected or exposed to abuse, ill-treatment, violence or other behaviour.[18]I was comfortably satisfied that an order for adoption would be inThomasandGeorgia’s best interests.I havebeen greatly assisted in hearing thevoicesofThomasandGeorgia, that is theirwishes and feelingsabout the adoption,through the court reports prepared pursuant to s 91 of theAdoption Actby Ms Gibbs filed 24 March 2023, and by Ms Robinson filed 22 May 2024.ThomasandGeorgiaare too young to provide their consent to their adoption.Nevertheless,Iwassatisfied thatthe children have an age-appropriate understanding ofadoption.It is clear that the childrenhave developed a strongandwarm connection withLauraandCraig.They callLauraandCraig“Mum”and“Dad”.Georgiaoften shares with her educators and peers,“I grew in my mummy’s heart”, showing herdeepbond withLauraandCraigand her age-appropriate understanding of what adoption would mean for their relationship.Thomasis known byLauraandCraig’s surname at school at his own request, showinghis sense of belonging within the adoptive family andhis age-appropriate understanding ofadoption.Georgiaalso calls herselfby Laura and Craig’s surname.LauraandCraigare supporting the children to understandtheir birth family history, and will help them to understand what open adoption means through life story work as they grow older.LauraandCraighave demonstrated a high capacity to provide forThomas’sandGeorgia’s physical, emotional and educational needs.LauraandCraigprovide the children withaloving home environment.They have taken extensive steps to supportThomaswith his diagnosis of complex trauma and symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, andGeorgiawith her diagnosis of speech articulation disorder and experiences of complex trauma and sleep disturbances. They have worked alongsideThomas’sandGeorgia’s educators to arrange additional support for the children at school and preschool respectively.They arebothfierce advocates forThomasandGeorgiaand are very attuned to their individual needs.LauraandCraighave demonstrated their positive attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood, andtheirloving commitment to the children. At the preliminary hearing,LauraandCraigtold methe following:“[Laura]:…[Thomas]and[Georgia]are doing really well in our care. They’re very happy. We love them endlessly. They’re a part of our extended family now. They’re in a great routine. They’re well supported…I’ll give a bit of an update.[Thomasis]at school and he feels like he belongs there. He’s really well known and valued. Some days are challenging for him in terms of his regulation and behavioural, but we know him really, really well and we’re putting in those supports for him so he can thrive. He’s a very clever little boy. Academically, he’s…at or beyond his outcome level.And[Georgia]- she’s the funniest little thing. She loves unicorns and rainbows and dancing and singing. She’s a very creative little girl who enjoys spending time with me one-on-one. We do that twice a week. And yeah, she’s got some great friends at preschool.[Thomas]just started cricket. They both enjoy swimming and our family holidays. Did you want to add anything,[Craig]? I could talk about them endlessly.[Craig]: Yeah. From our point of view, we can see… improvements in the kids.[Laura]: Yep.[Craig]: And for their outcomes… our thoughts are that…the best thing for the kids would be to continue the way they’re going.”It is clear that the children are thriving in the care ofLauraandCraig, despite the challengesthey face.As for the relationshipsbetweenLaura,Craig,Thomas,andGeorgia, it is clear thatthe childrenshare a strong connection withLauraandCraig.They enjoydoingfamily activities andtravelling onfamily holidays together.ThomasandGeorgiaare comfortable enough toshare their worries and fears withLauraandCraigbecause of the loving and safe environment thatLauraandCraigprovide for them.I have no doubt as to the suitability and capacity ofLauraandCraigto parentThomasandGeorgia. Ms Robinson notes in her court report thatLauraandCraig’s“capacity to give love to [the children] is evident in how they respond toThomasandGeorgia, especially in challenging situations”.Thechildren were removed from the birth parents’care in response to a number of Risk of Significant Harm reports,known as ROSH reports.Theserelated to concerns for the birth parents’ongoing and persistent drug use,mental health concerns, exposure to family and domestic violence, physical abuse, and neglect.Both children have made disclosures of being harmed,and being present while a third person was harmed,whilein their birth parents’care.Both children have histories of complex, early trauma in their birth parents’care.It is clear that the children have made significant gains in the care ofLauraandCraig.The parentsWhen consideringThomasandGeorgia’s best interests, I also had regard to the relationship thatBelindaandTimhave withThomasandGeorgiaand any wishes they, as thechildren’sbirth parents, have expressed about the adoption.[19]ThomasandGeorgiahave a good understanding of their relationship to their birth family.ThomasandGeorgiacallBelindaandTim“MummyBelinda”and“DaddyTim”.However, it is a difficult relationship associated with complex trauma for the children.Both children experience significant emotional dysregulationbefore andafter family visits withBelinda.As a result of concerns for the children’s behaviour, face-to-face family visits withBelindawere placed on holdfrom December 2022 to December 2023.The children have not had contact withTimsince November 2020due, in part, to his incarceration.LauraandCraigare committed to maintaining relationships withBelinda,Tim, and the wider maternal and paternal families.Through ongoing life story work, they are supportingThomasandGeorgiato develop an understanding of their connections with their birth family.They have worked closely withBarnardosand the children’s therapeutic supports to support the childrento positivelyengagein family visits. This allowed face-to-face family visits with Belinda toresumein December 2023.BothBelindaandTimopposed the adoption.At the preliminary hearing before me on 22 November 2023, I was able to hear directly fromBelindaandTimabout their wishes for the children.When asked about her position,Belindatold me:“[Belinda]: … I’m glad that[Thomas]and[Georgia]are feeling safe and starting to feel like they have a sense of belonging. And I’m happy that they seem to be thriving and I’m thankful for that. I – in sayingthat,I don’t want them to be adopted.”When asked about his position,Timtold me:“[Tim]: … Obviously, I don’t want to see them get adopted … I’ve got a lot of regrets and everything but … I want them to see their mother … I just want to start seeing them and that. Like, I’m in gaol at the moment … but, like, I just want to start seeing them. I just want the best for them, you know.… I would like to see them with their mum and that. Like, I know she’s doing good and, like, me and her had a toxic relationship, you know. But, like, me and her are not together no more. And like that - that - the arguing and the fighting is not there no more … So there’s not going to be, like, that problem what that was before, you know. Like, I’m out of the picture and that. Like, I’ll - I’ll be happy to see them, you know, every now and again and that. I just want … her just to be able to have them and … them to be back with their mum.”I am grateful to bothBelindaandTimfor the dignity with which they expressed their feelings at the preliminary hearing.At the time of the final hearing,Belindaopposedthe adoption order being made on the basis that the contact provided in the proposedAmendedMaternal Adoption Planwas in her viewinadequate and didnot promote the children’s best interests.Belindaexpressed herfeelings on this issuein her Affidavit filed 18 July 2024.I willreturn to thisbelow.Whether adoption is clearly preferable in the best interests of the childWhen consideringThomasandGeorgia’s best interests, I also had to besatisfied that the making ofanorderfor adoptionis“clearly preferable”in the best interests ofThomasandGeorgiathan any other action that could betaken by law in relation to their care.[20]The making of an adoption order must be obviously, plainly or manifestly preferable to any other action that could be taken by law.[21]Iwasnot satisfied that restoration of the children to eitherBelindaorTimis a realistic prospect, nor in the best interests ofThomasandGeorgia.[22]If I were to make no order and maintain the status quo,ThomasandGeorgiawould remain in the care ofLauraandCraig, but parental responsibility would remain with the Minister.In those circumstances,LauraandCraigwould beunable to make significant decisions regarding the children without approval of the Minister’s delegate,Barnardos.If I were to make orders for parental responsibility forThomasandGeorgiatoLauraandCraig, that would alleviate some of the disadvantages of taking no step, but thesewould be temporary orders that would expire whenThomasandGeorgiaattain 18 years of age.Iwassatisfied that the making of adoption ordersis clearly preferable in the best interests of the children. Adoptionwill provideThomasandGeorgiawith certainty, stability, and security. It will enableThomasandGeorgiato achieve a sense of belonging in the adoptive family, to a degree that no other lawful action could achieve.Indeed, adoption willbringtheir legal status into conformity with reality, andperfecttheir sense of permanent belonging in the family with which they identify as their own.[23]In reaching this conclusion, I have consideredHallenJ’s remarks inRe the Adoption of AJH:[24]“It is often referred to in the literature that a child placed with foster carers has an abiding need for a sense of security and identity and that she, or he, will feel most secure when she, or he, is assured that no one can take her, or him, away from the family of which she, or he, is a legal member. It is recognised that the sooner a child can feel this sense of security, the better for her, or his, development in the future: seeRe Peter[2009] NSWSC 697, per Palmer J, at [35].”Consent to the adoptionBefore making an adoption order, I must deal with the consent requirementsunder theAdoption Act.As the children’s birth parents,BelindaandTim’s consentwould be required to the proposed adoption ofThomasandGeorgiaunless, relevantly, consentwasdispensed with.[25]BelindaandTimdid notconsentto the adoption. Accordingly, theSecretarysoughtan order pursuant to s 67(1)(d) of theAdoption Actto dispense withtheirconsent.I may not make a consent dispense order unless satisfied that, relevantly,ThomasandGeorgiahaveestablished a stable relationship withLauraandCraig, and that the adoption byLauraandCraigwill promoteThomasandGeorgia’swelfare.[26]I must also be satisfied that to do so will be in the best interests ofThomasandGeorgia.[27]Dispensing with the consent of parents to the adoption of their child by proposed adoptive parents is a grave step, not lightly to be taken.[28]Nonetheless, I was comfortablysatisfied that I should dispense with the requirement forBelindaandTim’s consent. It is clear thatThomasandGeorgiahaveestablished astrong and secure attachment toLauraandCraig. Their relationship withLauraandCraigis loving and supportive, and I have no doubt the adoption will promoteThomasandGeorgia’s welfare.The making of a consent dispense order is in the best interests ofThomasandGeorgia.The Adoption PlansTheprimaryissue in dispute in these proceedingswastheproposed contact to take place post-adoptionbetweenThomasandGeorgiaand their birth family.The Secretary prepared adoption plans pursuant to s 46 of theAdoption Actthat includedprovisionsfor themeans and nature of contact betweenthechildrenand their birth family. DespiteBelindaandTimnot consenting to the adoption ofThomasandGeorgia, the Secretary has given them, as far as possible, the opportunity to participate in the development of, and agree to, the Adoption Plans.[29]The question before me is whether thoseproposed Adoption Plansare in thechildren’s best interests and proper in the circumstances,and,if so,whether thoseAdoption Plans should be approvedand registered.I have been greatly assisted by theexpertreports of Dr Jodie Park,Thomas’streating expert,dated 26 April 2024 and 19 May 2024, in considering what is in the best interests of the children for contact post-adoption.AmendedMaternal Adoption PlanThere is an AmendedMaternal Adoption Planwhich relates to the children,Belinda,Ava,and the maternal family.At the recommendation of Dr Park, the Plan provides a three-stage contact arrangementforpost-adoptionvisits withBelinda, whichAvawill attend jointly:In Stage 1, for at least the first 12 months after an adoption order is made, there will be structured planned face-to-face contact twice per year, and video/phone contact twice per year, for one hour minimum duration. The criteria to progress to Stage 2 isa“reduction in emotional dysregulation after contact”.In Stage 2, for at least 12 months after completing Stage 1, there will be structured planned face-to-face contact four times per year for one hour minimum duration. The criteria to progress to Stage 3 is:A“reduction in emotional dysregulation…before, during and after contact”;“The children are positive about attending contact”; and“After contact visits, the children are easily able to transition to their daily routine.”In Stage 3, being the long-term planfor contactuntil the children attain 18 years of age, there will be face-to-face contact at a venue to beagreed upon by the parties four times per year for two hours minimum duration.“Emotional dysregulation”is defined in the Amended Maternal Adoption Plan as meaning:“(a) changes in behaviour or emergence of previous behaviours or verbal expressions that have been linked to the children feeling anxious in the past. Changes in behaviour can include the children physically and emotionally withdrawing from adults during and after contact or demonstrating an increase in external anger or fear-based behaviours during or after contact;(b) an increase in negative statements about[Belinda]such as words like ‘unsafe’ or ‘bad’;(c) ongoing dysregulated behaviours after contact where the children are difficult to calm and do not respond to usual parenting strategies;(d) ongoing dysregulated behaviours that remain in place for days/weeks.”TheAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan also provides for future contact with the maternal grandfather and maternal aunt.As I have said above,ThomasandGeorgiafaceimmensechallengesin relation toattendingand participating infamilyvisits withBelinda. At the preliminary hearing,Lauratold me:“[Laura]: Family time can be really challenging for the kids. We tell them on the way in the car where they’re going because we wouldn’t be able to get them - it’d a struggle to get them in the car. … And then during contact, they do hold it together but show signs that they are struggling. But it’s the after that it’s serious regression.[Thomas]self-harms.[Georgia]has ten to 12 nightmares every night. It’s - it’s really hard for them.”At the time of the preliminary hearing in November 2023, family visits had been paused for some 11 monthsbecause of these challenges. It washopedthat the pause wouldallow the childrentime to access therapeutic supports anddevelop coping strategies for family visits.At the final hearing,Lauragave evidence about the three family visitsbetween the children andBelindathat have taken placesince the preliminary hearing: a face-to-face visit in December 2023, a face-to-face visit at or around Easter in2024, and a video call in June 2024.Lauragave evidence that thechildren displayed dysregulated, reactivebehaviours in anticipation ofthe December 2023 and Easter 2024 visits. In advance of the Easter 2024 visit,Georgiahad her“most extreme reaction”anddisplayedout-of-character behaviour at preschool.Both children made disclosures about their time in the care of their birth parents.While both children managed to use thecopingstrategies they had developed to participatemeaningfullyduring contact, the children’s daily lives were significantly impacted for some weeks after the family visits.Lauraobservedthatthe children displayed“less extreme”reactions prior to and after the June 2024 video call.LaurasaidthatThomastold her that FaceTimecontact withBelindawas“much easier”, andGeorgiaagreed with him.I was grateful toLaurafor the dignity with which she expressed herself when givingthisevidence.I have had regard toBelinda’s wishes about the proposed levels of contact withThomasandGeorgia.At the preliminary hearing in November 2023,Belindaexpressed her position on the levels of contact occurring at that time:“[Belinda]: … So I’m doing everything I possibly can to better myself so that I can build a better relationship between myself and[Thomas]and[Georgia]because I just want - I understand that[Thomas]and[Georgia]and myself - we all have shared trauma. And they place me with that trauma. And I understand that. But … I just want to get to a place where that we can all be happy and content to see each other because all I want is to have the best relationship possible with my children if I can’t get them back in my care full-time.Yeah, I just don’t think that we have any agreements about visitations. So I haven’t seen the kids since December last year face-to-face. I think that that’s the reason that the kids are reacting to the visits so badly is because last year I was seeing them once a month…the first weekend of every month. And then this year, I didn’t - I have not seen them one time. So I think that it’s just contributing because it just got ripped away from under their feet out of nowhere - the visitations.”Belindaalso expressed her positionin relation to theAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan in herAffidavitaffirmed 18July 2024:“I believe that the limited contact that has recently been occurring is contributing to the children’s anxiety around contact. If contact were to occur on a moreregular basis for short periods of time I believe that the children’s experience of contact would be positive.…I do not want to force the children to have contact and will always be guided by what is in their best interests, and would like the adoptive parents andBarnardosto support more frequent contact that would provide the children with opportunities to build their trust and confidence around contact.This proposed contact does not consider the need for the children to have a meaningful relationship with[Ava].”Atthefinalhearing before me on 30 July 2024, I had this exchange withLaura:“HIS HONOURQ. Mr Fitzgerald[who appeared forBelinda]didn't ask, but I'd like to know. Do you have anything you'd like to say about how[Belinda]has managed the face to face, and then the[FaceTime]encounters?A. Great. She's taken on all.Q. She is tryinghard?A. Yep, taken on all the strategies that have been asked. And from our perspective, we're so grateful because the kids are able to, you know, try these strategies and everybody is working together.Q. Doing the best she can?A. Yes. Like I said, at the end of the last face to face visit, we just want it to be positive for everyone. We just want this to be, everybody to come together and have a positive time together and leave and not have, you know, hardships after. Like, we want it to be positive for everyone involved.”I am grateful toLaurafor hergenerosity in giving this evidence aboutBelinda. I have no doubt thatBelindais doing her best positivelytoengage with the children at family visits. Nevertheless, my focusmust beonwhether the contact arrangements in theAmendedMaternal Adoption Plan are in thechildren’s best interestsand proper in the circumstances.I have had regard to the children’s emotional needs,[30]the children’s relationship withBelinda,[31]and the need to protect the children from the physical andpsychological harm that has been caused to them.[32]It is clear that family visits play a part in reactivating the children’s histories of trauma.Thomas’sandGeorgia’s relationship withBelindaissignificantlyaffected by the harm they experienced whilst in her care, and thechildrenrequire timetoovercome their fear andregain trustwithBelinda.IwassatisfiedthatDr Park’s recommended three-stage approach to family visits withBelindaandAvais in the children’s best interests andisproper in the circumstances.The approach is responsive to the needs of the children, and allows visits to be increased graduallyandwhen the children are ready.LauraandCraighave diligently worked to support family visits between the children andBelinda, andI have no doubt they will continueworking closely with the children to help them develop and use coping strategies to positively engage in family visits withBelindain accordance withthe stages of theAmended Maternal Adoption Plan.Iwasnot prepared to impose any furtherfamilyvisit requirements onThomasandGeorgiaat this time.If an adoption plan is registered, it has the effect, on the making of an adoption order, as if the adoption plan were part of the order.[33]A party to an adoption plan, that is someone who has signed it, can, once it is registered, seek to enforce it as an order of the Court. A party to an adoption plan can also apply the Court for a review ofan adoption plan.[34]The Court may make such changes, if any, to the provisions of the adoption plan as it considers proper in the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.[35]During a short adjournment at the final hearing, followingLaura’s evidence,Belindasigned the Amended Maternal Adoption Plan. Even thoughBelindaaspires to increased contact withThomasandGeorgiathan what is provided in the Amended Maternal Adoption Plan, I hope she may take comfort that she is a party to the plan, and can apply to the Court at any time for a review of theplan.The Amended Maternal Adoption Plan also allows the parties to approach a Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner to seek a mediation to resolve any difficulties in relation to the implementation or review of the plan.AmendedPaternal Adoption PlanThere is anAmendedPaternal Adoption Planwhich relates to the children,Tim, and the paternal family.At the recommendation of Dr Park, the Plan provides afour-stage contact arrangement for post-adoption visits withTim:In Stage 1, for at least the first 12 months after an adoption order is made,Timis to provide photographs, cards and letters to in effect“re-introduce himself”to the children. The criteria to progress to Stage 2 is thatTimprovides the information, andTimis not incarcerated.[36]In Stage 2, for at least 12 months after completing Stage 1, there will bevideo/phone contact twice per year for 30 minutes minimum duration.The criteria to progress to Stage 3 is:completion of Stage 2;“Limited emotional dysregulation”;“The children are positive about attending contact”;“After contact visits, the children are easily able to transition to their daily routine.”In Stage 3, for at least 12 months after completing Stage 2, there will be structured planned face-to-face contact once per year, and video/phone contact once per year, for one hour minimum duration. The criteria to progress to Stage 4 is:“Limited emotional dysregulation…demonstrated by the children before, during and after contact”;“The children are positive about attending contact”;“After contact visits, the children are easily able to transition to their daily routine.”In Stage4, being the long-term plan for contact until the children attain 18 years of age, there will be face-to-face contacttwotimes per year forone hourminimum duration.“Emotional dysregulation”is given the same definition in the Amended Paternal Adoption Plan as in the Amended Maternal Adoption Plan, with the exception that it insertsTim’s name intheplace ofBelinda’s name.The AmendedPaternal Adoption Plan also provides for future contact with the paternal half-siblings and the paternal grandmother.As I have said above,ThomasandGeorgiahave not had contact withTimsince November 2020. The Secretary submittedthat the staged approach provided in the Amended Paternal Adoption Plan is necessary tore-establish contact between the children andTimovertime. Stages 1 and 2 may occur concurrently in the first 12 months after an adoption order is made, provided the criteria to progressto Stage 2is satisfied.At the final hearing, I had this exchange withTim:“HIS HONOURQ. The second stage during the first 12 months, when I make the order you will have video contact with the children but it would lead in due course, perhaps over some years, to face to face and, ultimately, actually seeing them. That looks to me as if it is a very sensible and gradual, no doubt from your point of view, slow, but simple way ofre establishingthe kids' relationship with you.A. Yes.Q. How do you feel about that?A. Well, it is a long time, you know, but I know what I have got to do, but over a few years, that is a long time.”Having regard to the children’s emotional needs,[37]the children’s relationship withTim,[38]and the need to protect the children from the physical and psychological harm that has been caused to them,[39]Iwassatisfied that the Amended Paternal Adoption Plan is in the children’s best interests and is proper in the circumstances.It will enable the children to re-establish asafe and positiverelationship withTim.Timdid not sign theAmendedPaternal Adoption Plan, and so is not a party to it. He cannot apply for review of the planin this Court.However,I note that the Amended Paternal Adoption Plan does allowTimto approach a Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner to seek a mediation to resolve any difficulties in relation to the implementation or review of the plan.Proposed name changeIt was proposed that, on the making of the adoption orders, the children wouldtake Laura and Craig’s surname, and retain their given names.Before changingthe names of the child, I must consider any wishes expressed by the child and any factors relevant to the weight that should be given to those wishes.[40]The children have expressed a clear wish to change their names to takeLauraandCraig’s surname.As I have said above,Thomashas already chosen to be calledby that surnameat school,andGeorgiacalls herselfby that surname.Iwassatisfied that the proposed name changes are in the children’sbest interests.The proposed surname will reflectThomasandGeorgia’smembership of the adoptive family, and enhancetheirsense of belonging andstability.The children will continue to have their birth middle names, which will preservetheirongoingconnection to their birth family.ConclusionAdoption serves the identity needs of the child in question, in circumstances where they are emotionally, psychologically andas a matter of factalready members of the proposed adoptive family, bringing their legal status into conformity with reality, and by perfecting their sense of permanent belonging in the family with which they identify as their own, not only during childhood but for life.[41]I had no doubt that it was in the best interests of these children to make the adoption orders sought.Integrated Birth Certificateswill be createdforThomasandGeorgiawhich will include details ofBelindaandTim.Those certificateswillform an important part ofthe children’s life story.**********Endnotes1.Status of Children Act, s 21(1)(d); see Principal Officer, Family Spirit Adoption Services v D (ANONYMISED) [2022] NSWSC 142 at [11] (Sackar J).2.Status of Children Act, s 21(2).3.Adoption of BS (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 2033 at [100] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was); Adoption Act, Pt 8.4.Adoption Act, s 23(2)(a).5.Adoption Act, s 28(1)(a).6.Adoption Act, s 28(1)(b).7.Adoption Act, s 90(1)(c).8.Adoption Act, ss 28(3)-(4).9.Adoption Act, s 8(1)(b).10.Adoption Act, s 8(1)(c).11.Adoption Act, ss 8(1)(a), 90(1)(a).12.Adoption Act, s 8(1)(a).13.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(a).14.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(c).15.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(g).16.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(h).17.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(i).18.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(j).19.Adoption Act, ss 8(2)(e)-(f).20.Adoption Act, s 90(3).21.Adoption of RCC and RZA [2015] NSWSC 813 at [14] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was).22.I must consider restoration as an alternative to adoption: see Adoption of Taylor-Clay [2019] NSWSC 27 at [66] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was); Adoption of RCC and RZA (supra) at [69]‑[72] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was).23.Adoption of Taylor-Clay (supra) at [58] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was).24.[2017] NSWSC 1751 at [297].25.Adoption Act, ss 52, 54.26.Adoption Act, ss 67(1)(d)(i)-(ii).27.Adoption Act, s 67(2).28.See, for example, Adoption of RCC and RZA (supra) at [17] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was).29.Adoption Act, s 46(2).30.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(c).31.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(f).32.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(j).33.Adoption Act, s 50(4).34.Adoption Act, s 51(1).35.Adoption Act, ss 51(3)-(4).36.Tim informed me at the final hearing that he may be released from prison in or about October 2024.37.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(c).38.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(f).39.Adoption Act, s 8(2)(j).40.Adoption Act, s 101(2).41.Adoption of Taylor-Clay (supra) at [58] (Brereton J, as the Commissioner then was).Amendments15 August 2024\n\t\n\n - \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tName anonymised at [46].DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

TheInterestedPartiesgave evidence and made submissions in opposition to the grant of any extensionorder.It is common ground that the relation-back day for Futurepower was 4 February 2021, such that any application for orders pursuant to s 588FF(1) of the Act, or any application to extend the period for the bringing of such application pursuant to s 588FF(3) of the Act, had to be brought by 4 February 2024. This application for an extension was brought within time. There is, therefore, jurisdiction to make an order under s 588FF(3). The issue for determination is whether, as a matter of discretion, such an order should be made.BackgroundFuturepower’s businessFuturepower was incorporated on 17 March 2003. Since 2 February 2006, Ms Carbone has been its sole director and shareholder.Prior to its liquidation, Futurepower operated a land development business,includingin partnership with M&S Investments (NSW) Pty Ltd(M&S).Futurepower and M&S hold, as tenants in common in equal shares, property located at 300 Jardine Drive, Edmondson Park, NSW (theProperty).In 2012, Liverpool City Council granted consent to Futurepower and M&S to conduct a subdivision of the Property (such consent later being modifiedto permit subdivision to be carried out over 3 stages).According to Ms Carbone, lots inStage 1 of the subdivision of the Property were soldbetweenAugust and September 2015 for atotalamount of $5,709,500. Futurepower did not at that time, or subsequently, maintain a bank account. Ms Carbone deposes that Futurepower’s share of the profit fromStage 1 of the subdivision was transferred to her or at her direction in reduction of a debtowed to her by Futurepower.According to Ms Carbone, lots in Stage 2 of the subdivision of the Property were soldbetweenMarch and April 2017 for a price of $7.039m. Ms Carbone deposes that, as was the case withStage 1, Futurepower’s share of theprofitsfor Stage 2 was transferred to her or at her direction.Futurepower retained a law firm trading under the name BarclaysLaw Group (Barclays). This firm is owned and operated byMrCarbone.It appears that, as well as providing legal services to Futurepower, Mr Carbone had some role in relation to Futurepower’s management, the nature and extent of which is uncertain.In his affidavit,Mr Carbone deposed that he often gave his wife advice on,and assisted with,Futurepower’s business affairs. Between December 2016 and October 2019,Barclays rendered invoices to Futurepower for fees and disbursements totalling $1.29m.Futurepower goes into liquidationIn July 2018, theAustralian Taxation Office (ATO)wrote to Futurepower and M&S advising that it wouldbe conductingan audit into their GST and income tax obligations. Futurepower retained PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC)to prepare submissions to the ATO. InApril 2020, the ATOcompleted its audit and assessed“extra tax”of around $1.365m to be payable by Futurepower.InOctober 2019, this Court made orders dismissing a claim brought by Futurepower in litigation against an entity known as TRN Group. The Court subsequently ordered that Futurepower pay TRN Group’s costs on an indemnity basis. Those costs were notpaidand TRN Group issued a creditor’s statutory demand which went unsatisfied.Proceedings for the winding up of Futurepower were commenced on 4 February 2021.On 8 March 2021, the Court ordered that Futurepower be wound up in insolvency.Creditor claims exceed $3.5m, includingmore than$1.5m owing to the ATO and $646,537.53 owing to the TRN Group.Upon entry into liquidation, Futurepower had nominal liquid assets. Ithad,on its books, a loan to Ms Carbone in the amount of around $1.393m (theDirector Loan). It also retains its interest in the Property. Each of the Director Loan and the Property remains subject to ongoing litigation, which is described further below. The Liquidator has proceededto dateon an unfunded basis and has drawn no remuneration.In July 2024, the Liquidatorsought and obtained creditors’approval for entry into a funding agreementfor the purpose of conducting public examinations.Investigations by the LiquidatorThe Liquidator gave evidence ofthe steps takento obtain books and records relating to Futurepower, including exhibiting extensive correspondence about those matters with Ms Carbone, Barclays and third parties.The Liquidator was cross-examined at some length about these investigations and the responses received, and the submissionsby theInterestedPartiesfocussed on the relevant timelineand the extent of any delay by the Liquidator in pursuing his investigations. It is therefore necessary to provide some detail regardingthese matters.Requests directed to Ms CarboneOn 11 March 2021, the Liquidator issued, several days after his appointment, a statutory notice to Ms Carbone seeking delivery of all books and records of Futurepower. The Liquidator also required Ms Carbone to complete aReporton Company Activities and Property (ROCAP).On 6 April 2021, Ms Carbone completed the ROCAP which, among other things,statedthat Futurepower’s main activity was“Subdividedresidentialland”; that it had ceased trading asatMarch 2021; and that itdid not operate any bank account.In addition, Ms Carbone indicated in the ROCAP that Futurepower did not keep any electronic records or any paper records. She also indicatedthat Mr Nick Fontana of the accounting firm John P Natoli & Associates (Natoli) had prepared the most recent income tax return and Business Activity Statement forFuturepower, andcould provide copies ofFuturepower’sfinancial statements.On 4 May 2021, the Liquidator sought clarification from Ms Carbone on various matters arising from the ROCAP, includingwhether Futurepowerhad ever maintained a bank account in its own name. In addition, the Liquidator referred to the indication in the ROCAP that Futurepower did not keep any records (in paper or electronic form),andasked“how financial records were recorded for reporting to the ATO”. The Liquidator alsorequested that Ms Carboneprovide“all company correspondence including any email correspondence concerning the property”.On 3 June 2021, the Liquidator followed up on this request, having not received a response.On 17 June 2021, Ms Carbone responded by email to the Liquidator’s queries. She stated that Futurepower held a joint bank account with M&S, but that she could not locate any other bank details. She also stated that MrBilaverof M&S managed the development project on the part of M&S and Futurepowerand that most of the paper records and correspondence concerningthe Property were sent to him; and thatFuturepower’stax affairs and liabilities were handledby Natoli“who possess any relevant records”. She also confirmed that Futurepower had never owned any other property over which it had conducted any subdivision activity.Ms Carbone also provided various documents to the Liquidator at this time, including a Costs Disclosurefrom Barclaysand various invoices which were issued by Barclays to Futurepower. One of those invoiceswhichwas addressed to Futurepower was for an amount of $299,750 (includingGST) and was specified to relate to a different property in Edmondson Park which is owned by Ms Carbone (not Futurepower).On 13 July 2021, the Liquidator sent a further letter to Ms Carbone, noting her statement that Futurepower did not operate a bank account and noting that Futurepower recorded incomewith the ATOforeachof the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years. The Liquidator askedfor“an explanationas to wherethis income has been receipted”andrequested“all relevant documents and statements regarding the receipt of this income”. The Liquidator also indicated that, if this information was not provided within 14 days, he would seek the assistance of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC).The Liquidator did not receive any response from Ms Carbone to the request for information regarding where income was receipted, or any documents regarding the receipt of income.On 5 October 2021, the Liquidator lodged a request for ASIC’s assistance in the administration of Futurepower, referring to the failure of Ms Carbone to assist. ASIC appears to have written to Ms Carbone on 1 November 2021, leading to a response from Barclays on 11 November 2021.In this response, Barclays stated thatMs Carbonehad answered the Liquidator’s requests for documents by referringthe Liquidator to Natoli and M&S.On 2 February 2022, the Liquidator caused Futurepower to commence a proceeding in this Court against Ms Carbone, seeking recovery oftheDirector Loan(theDirector Loan Proceedings). On 11 April 2022, Ms Carbone filed adefence in which she referred to an agreement between PwC and the ATO, in the course of the ATO’s audit of Futurepower,to the effectthat certain adjustments in income would be characterised as project management fees which were notionally payableby Ms Carbone to theCompany, andpleadedthat these book entries did not evidence any indebtedness of Ms Carbone to Futurepower.On 3 August 2022, the Liquidator issued a s 530B notice to Ms Carbone.This was the first request for documents from Ms Carbone since late 2021. This sought, inter alia, copies of all correspondence between Ms Carbone or Futurepower and the ATO, PwC or Natoli; any legal or accounting advice provided to Futurepower in relation to its obligation to pay or account for GST; and all personal bank records for the period 2003 to the present,“for any accounts where you have lent money to [Futurepower], paid expenses on behalf of [Futurepower], or received payment from [Futurepower]”.The Liquidator sought this information regarding personal bank records because he had learned from Mr Carbone that payments were made from the sale proceeds for Stage 1 and Stage 2 to Ms Carbone(see paragraph [39] below).On 29 August 2022, the Liquidator followed up, seeking a response to this notice. On 13 September 2022, the Liquidator sent an email to Ms Carbone’s solicitors in the Director LoanProceedings noting that there had been no response to the s 530Bnotice, andattaching a Notice to Produce for Inspection. TheInterestedParties suggested that thisNotice to Producereplaced the s 530B notice. However, as set out below,there continued to be correspondence regarding compliance with the s 530B notice.On 17 November 2022, Ms Carbone wrote to the Liquidator’s solicitors, refusing to produce her personal bank records on the basis that they“are not books and records of the company”.On 10 February 2023, the Liquidator’s solicitors wrote to Ms Carbone’s solicitors, referring to the s 530B notice and noting that Ms Carbone’s solicitors had responded on 3 February 2023 that she had already complied with thes530Bnotice. The Liquidator’s solicitors sought that Ms Carbone confirm on oath, by 20 February 2023, that there were no further documents to be provided in response to thes530Bnotice. The letter added:“We would also be pleased if you would advise on what basis our client shouldn’t conduct an examination of your client pursuant to s. 596ACorporations Act2001 in relation to the examinable affairs of the company.”Ms Carbone’s solicitors responded on 20 February 2023,stating as follows:“Contrary to order 1 made by Registrar Jones on 6 February 2023, your letter did not specify what documents our clients failed to produce in answer to the section 530B Notice and/or the Notice to Produce. In these circumstances, we presume that your client will not be filing any Notice of Motion and the liquidator should serve his evidence without any further delay.…It is a matter for the liquidator to decide whether he wishes to make an application for public examinations.We do not see why the liquidator would proceed with public examinations in circumstances where he has already sought production of documents using both curial and extra-curial processes with limited success over many months. The liquidator should focus on progressing this case rather than wasting further time pursuing public examinations.”The Liquidator did not file any Notice of Motion in respect of the s 530B notice, or engage in any further correspondence about that notice, or pursue examinations at that time.Requests directed to Barclays (Mr Carbone)On 6 May 2021, the Liquidator issued a statutory notice toBarclays, seeking production ofany documents or records regarding the business activitiesof Futurepower, anyfilespertaining to any litigation or potential litigation, andall documents pertaining to any legal advice or correspondence provided to Futurepower.On 3 June 2021, having not receivedany response,the Liquidatorfollowed uponthat request.In addition, the Liquidator sought“all account records regarding any trust account transactions in respect of[Futurepower]”.On 21 June 2021, Mr Carbone stated in an email that there were no trust account transactions or records for Futurepower. Mr Carbone alsoasserted a lien over the files for unpaid fees.On 12 July 2021, theLiquidator queried the lack of any trust account transactions, given that Barclays had acted for Futurepower in relation to the sale of the lots.The Liquidator sought confirmation from Mr Carbone that“you have at no point in time received any money on behalf of the Company or processed any income or transactions regarding the Company through you[r] trust account”.TheLiquidatoralso disputed the suggestion that a lien could be relied upon in answer to a notice issued by the company’s liquidator,referringtos530B(1)(b) of the Act.On 30 August 2021, Mr Carbone responded thatno files could be produced for inspection while the current COVID lockdown was in place. (It was common ground that this lockdownlasted from July to October 2021.)Mr Carbonealso stated thatthe existence of trust account recordsin relation to“stage 1”–which, as noted above, had involved the sale of various lots in a subdivision of the Property for$5,719,500–“willbe clarified when files are retrieved for inspection”.In his email of 30 August 2021, Mr Carbone also told the Liquidator that“the sale proceeds from Stages 1 and 2 were paid to the director [Ms Carbone] to discharge loans to the company”, adding:“All acquisition, holding and development costs of Futurepower, were loaned by the director and repaid”. As noted above, the provision of this information led to theLiquidatorseeking personal bank records of Ms Carbone, which she subsequently refused to provideto the Liquidator.There was an extended back and forth about the production of the files. It is not necessary to go into the detail of the relevant correspondence.By early 2023, Barclays still had not providedallfiles to the Liquidator. The solicitors for the Liquidator wrote to Barclays on 7 February 2023 seeking“as a matter of urgency”an indication of Barclays’intentions with respect to thes530Bnotice, andindicating that they intended to seek instructions from theLiquidator“to compel production from you pursuant to a summons for examination under s.596B of theCorporations Act 2001(Cth) or an application for delivery pursuant to s.472 of theLegal Professional Uniform Law”. A similar statement was made on3March 2023.This shows that the Liquidator was, asatFebruary 2023, considering proceeding with examinations, in circumstances where there had been extended non-compliance with requests for documents. There followed further correspondence between the Liquidator and Barclays and documents wereprovided tothe Liquidator on 29 May 2023.Despite having retrieved its files relating to Futurepower, Barclays does not appear to have confirmed to the Liquidator, following such retrieval,whether or notthere existed trust account records in relation to“stage 1”.Requestsdirected to NatoliTheLiquidator has also sought to obtain books and records from Futurepower’s accountants, Natoli.On 4 May 2021, the Liquidator issued a notice toNatoli, seeking production of books and records of Futurepower. This was followed up on 8 July 2021, in circumstances where no response had been received.On 9 July 2021, Natoli produced financial statements for Futurepower for the previous five years.On 14 July 2021, the Liquidator sent a further request toNatoli. He noted that the financial reports provided by Natoli reportedpartnership income and requested all applicable partnership entity tax returns. The Liquidatoralso referred to the Director Loanrecorded in the financial statementsand requested all documentation regarding this loan. In addition,the Liquidatornoted that he had not received a response to a request of 3 June 2021 seeking books and records of M&S.There appears to have been a significant delay by Natoli in responding to these requests.On 22 March 2022, some 8 months after the request of 14 July 2021 had been made, theLiquidator’ssolicitors wrote to Natoli, referring to the demands for books and records made on 4 May 2021 and 14 July 2021 and noting that Natoli had“failed or refused to provide all documents requested to our client”.On 25 March 2022, Natoli responded that, so far as the books and records of M&S were concerned, the directors of that entity had not given approval to Natoli to provide this information to the Liquidator. Natoli also stated that PwC could provide the Liquidator with“working papers for [Futurepower] as they were acting for [Futurepower] and Angela Carbone during this period”.TheLiquidatorreceived some documents from PwC in March 2022, and subsequently issued a s 530B notice to PwC. In August 2022, PwC responded thattheyhad no further documentsrelating to Futurepower beyond those already provided.Outcome of InvestigationsHaving regard to the matters outlined above, the Liquidator was in a positionby early 2023where:Ms Carbone had indicated that Futurepower had nopaper or electronicrecords, and that records relating to Futurepower’s business should be sought from M&S and Natoli;the Liquidatorhadsought documents fromM&S, butthe directors of M&Shadrefused to provide any such material;the Liquidatorhadsought documents fromNatoli, whohadprovided a limited number of financial reports and otherwise said all relevant material was held by PwC;andthe Liquidator had sought documents from PwC, whohadindicated that they heldonlylimited material(which they provided).In addition:Ms Carbone had not answered the Liquidator’s questionsabout what had happened to the income received from Stage 1 and Stage 2;the Liquidator had subsequently learned from Mr Carbone that payments from these receipts were made to Ms Carbone for expenses which she had paid on behalf of Futurepower;the Liquidator had sought personal bank records from Ms Carbone by way of a s 530B notice, but Ms Carbone refused to provide any of her personal bank statements showing any such receipts or payments, because they were not books and records of the company;andBarclays had indicated that it would provide clarification on whether there were any trust account transactionsrelating to Stage 1once it retrieved itsfiles, buttook some two years to provide copies of its files to the Liquidator, and did not subsequently provide any such confirmation.Other ProceedingsAs set out above, the Liquidator commencedthe Director Loan Proceedingsagainst Ms Carbone in this Court in February 2022.Orders were madein the Director Loan ProceedingsforFuturepowerto file evidence ona number ofoccasions in 2022 and early 2023. A number of these orders were not complied with, andthedeadline for the filing of this evidencewas subsequently extended(includingby consent). The Liquidator indicated that thesedelays occurred in circumstances where there were delaysby Ms Carboneinprovidingdocuments in response tothe s 503Bnoticeand the Notice to Produce.Ms Carbone filed her evidence in the Director Loan Proceedings in March 2024. She too had failed to comply witha number ofprevious orders to do so. Following the service of this evidence, the parties participated in a mediation which was unsuccessful.The Director LoanProceedingsare listed to be heard in December 2024.In addition, there are proceedings in the Land & Environment Court relating to the Property(theLEC Proceedings).In a report to creditors on 8 July 2024, theLiquidatorstated that the Property, which is co-owned with M&S, was estimatedin the ROCAPto have a realisable value of $1.5m for each party (based on a totalrealisablevalue of $3m). However, this valuation was“subject to the land being developed and is not areflectionon the current value of the land in its present state”. That is because the Property“has approximately 3,000 tonnes of asbestos laced soil dumped on it”. The report added:“As such, any valuation of the Lot and expectedrealisablevalue will be impacted, due to the costs of removing the contaminated soil andcomplyingwith any additional council and environmental requirements”. Thereportalso noted that M&S had been pursuing various parties in theLEC Proceedingsseeking, among other things, an order for the land to be remediated.TheLiquidator’sreport stated that, asat8 July 2024,the LEC Proceedingshad not been successful.In his affidavit,Mr Carbone provided further information regardingthe LEC Proceedings. Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone are, respectively, the fourth and fifth defendants inthe LEC Proceedings.They, together with other defendants, had brought an application to strike out M&S’s claimson theground thatthose claimswerestatute-barred. They succeeded at first instance, with orders being made on 16 June 2023 dismissing M&S’s summons against them. However, on 7 February 2024, the Court of Appeal upheld M&S’s appeal against that decision. As a result, theLEC Proceedingswereremitted back to the Land & Environment Court for case management and then hearing.Finally, theLiquidator’sreportof 8 July 2024indicated that M&S had agreed to sell the Property by auction, and that a real estate agent had been engaged.Havingregardingto the matters set out above,the Liquidator has, to date,been unable to realise the two main assets shown on the books of Futurepower, being the Director Loan and its interest in the Property. In those circumstances, the Liquidator has remained unfunded.When the Liquidator brought this application for an order under s 588FF(3), he indicated, in his supporting affidavit, that he intended to proceed with the examinations without funding, and that his solicitors had agreed to act inrelation totheproposedexaminations on a speculative basis. However, in July 2024, the Liquidator sought, and obtained, approval from creditorsfor entry into an agreement for the funding of public examinations into the affairs of Futurepower.An originating process and examination summons have been drafted and await the outcome of this application.The Liquidator seeks a12 monthextension of the period within which to bring any claim under s 588FF(1) of the Act, on the basis that he estimates a further 12 months will be required in order to convene and hold those public examinations, take advice and commence any recovery actions under that provision.Evidence ofMs Carbone and Mr CarboneMs Carbone and Mr Carbone oppose the Liquidator’s application. Each has given evidence of ill health and the toll that the continued uncertainty aboutwhether any proceedings will be brought is taking on them,particularlyin circumstances where they are involved in both the Director LoanProceedingsand theLEC Proceedings.It is unnecessary, in this judgment, to go into detail regarding their respective medical conditions. It issufficientfor present purposes to notethe following matters.Ms Carbone’s conditions were diagnosed in 2018. She takes a range of medication to deal with these conditions,and this medication hasa number ofside effects. She has also had surgery and requires further major surgery following which she will require aroundthreemonths of extensive physiotherapy andhydrotherapy.Mr Carbone’s conditioncommencedin2021, andrequiresregular check-ups and medication.Neither Ms Carbone nor Mr Carbone has given evidence to the effect that these conditions have prevented or hampered their ability to participate in the Director LoanProceedingsor theLEC Proceedings.However, each has givenevidenceto the effect that any further litigation, or the threat of continuing litigation out of the winding up of Futurepower, will causefurther stress and anxiety to themand their family.Ms Carbonedeposedthat the“prolongation of theliquidationand the potential for fresh litigation to be commenced against me on top of the existing litigation theliquidatoris pursuing me for in respect of the purported loanreceivablepayable to [Futurepower] causes me significant anxiety and stress”.In addition, Mr Carbonedeposedthat any extension of time granted to the Liquidator to pursue voidabletransactionsagainst him or his wife“has the potential to divert our attention away from and to disrupt our preparation of our defences to theLECProceedings”.Relevant PrinciplesSection 588FF(3) of the Act provides as follows:An application under subsection (1) may only be made:(a)during the period beginning on the relation-back day and ending:(i)3 years after the relation-back day; or(ii)12 months after the first appointment of a liquidator in relation to the winding up of the company;whichever is the later; or(b)within such longer period as the Court orders on an application under this paragraph made by the liquidator during the paragraph (a) period.It was common ground that the applicationunder s 588FF(3)(b)has been brought withinthe period specified in s 588FF(3)(b). It follows thatthere is power to make an order under s 588FF(3)(b) extending the period within which an application under s588FF(1) may be made. The question for determinationis whether, as a matter of discretion, the Court should makethe extension order which is sought by the Liquidator.The relevant principles were not in dispute.InFortress CreditCorporation (Australia) II Pty Ltd vFletcher(2015) 254 CLR 489; [2015] HCA 10 at [24], the High Court observed that:“The function of s 588FF(3)(b), which reflects its immediate purpose, is to confer a discretion on the court to mitigate, in an appropriate case, the rigours of the time limits imposed by para (a). That is a discretion to be exercised having regard to the scope and purposes of Pt 5.7B, characterised in the Harmer Report as the continuing‘policy’which underpinned its recommendations. That policy included the avoidance of transactions by which an insolvent company has disposed of property in circumstances that are regarded by the legislature as unfair to the general body of unsecured creditors. It is, however, a policy qualified in its application by the requirement that liquidators be placed under a reasonable time limitation fortaking actionunder the voidable transaction provisions. A purpose of that qualification, expressed in‘clear and emphatic’terms, is to favour certainty for those who haveentered intotransactions with the company during the periods in respect of which designated transactions may be voidable. There is, however, no independent basis for the assertion that any extension of time which does not identify a particular transaction or transactions must be an unreasonable prolongation ofuncertainty militating against a construction which would allow such an order to be made. The section provides for the exercise of discretion by the court. Questions of what is a reasonable or an unreasonable prolongation of uncertainty and the scope of such uncertainty are more appropriately considered case-by-case in the exercise of judicial discretion than globally in judicial interpretation of the provision.”InBPAustralia Ltd vBrown(2003) 58 NSWLR 322;[2003] NSWCA 216,Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed)said that an applicant must satisfy the court positively that an extension oughtbemade: at [183]. However, nothing in the section“specifies any criterion to be taken into account when exercising the discretion or any other matter which governs the exercise of the discretion”: at [182]. His Honour identified theneed to determine, in such an application, whetheritis”fair andjust in all of the circumstances”to grant the relevant extension: at [187]. In considering that issue, the Court should have regard to, on the one hand, the liquidator’s explanation for delay and, on the other, the prejudice the defendant would sufferas a result ofthe extension. His Honour made the following observations (at [101]-[102]):“Where the underlying principle is one of fairness, it is easy to appreciate that the passage of time affects the balance of fairness. The range of pre-liquidation transactions which are subject to avoidance under the statutory regime clearly involve a process of balancing conflicting interests, relevantly, between the general body of creditors on the one hand and, on the other hand, others who have taken advantage of the company including, but not limited to, particular creditors. In somerespectsthe legislative scheme balances these interests. In otherrespectsit leaves the balancing, or rebalancing, of those interests to the courts.The passage of time affects the fairness of a court ordering that an advantage be surrendered, including the application, relevantly for the purposes of the present case, of the principle of equality amongst creditors. The longer a person has retained a particular benefit, the more disruptive it will be to that person to be forced to surrender it. The appropriate balance between these conflicting interests is affected by delay. The passage of time may, of itself, tilt the balance of fairness. It does not necessarily do so and, accordingly, it isappropriate that there be a discretion to extend time.”His Honour alsocommented (at [119]) that:“In a context where conflicting interests have to be balanced, the eventual loss of the ability to make a relevant claim can reasonably be regarded as something to be surrendered, in favour of providing certainty to others who have had dealings with the company, including other creditors, so that they canproceed with their business affairs with an assurance that they are no longer at risk.”InNew Cap ReinsuranceCorp Ltd (in liq) vReasegurosAlianzaSA[2004] NSWSC 787 at [52], White J observed that the mattersto be consideredin such an application would ordinarily includethe following:theexplanation for the delay in bringing the proceedings;a preliminary review of the merits of theforeshadowed proceedings, directed to whether they were so devoid of prospects that it would be unfair, by granting an extension, to expose the other party to the continuing prospect of suit; andwhether the likely or actual prejudice resulting from the grant of the extension was sufficient substantially to outweigh the case for granting an extension.As regards the second of those matters, White Jnoted that, where the liquidator’s purpose in seeking the extension of time was to further investigate to determinewhether or notto bring proceedings, a preliminary enquiry into the merits of any consequent proceedings may not always be necessary.This list of factorswerereferred to, with approval, by Barrett J inArnautovic& Anor as joint liquidators of Australian Coal Technology Pty ltdv Nichola& Ors trading asMiddletonsLawyers[2009] NSWSC 233: at [7].The relevant factors werealsosummarised, in similar terms, by Ward JinReClarecastlePty Ltd (in liq)(2011) 85 ACSR 260; [2011] NSWSC 857 at [22].TheInterestedParties relied on observations by her Honour in that case (at [141]) that there had been“a seemingly deliberate decision”on the part of the liquidators“not to pursue, in as timely a fashion as (with hindsight) it is clear that they could have done, the investigations for which an extension is now sought”, which might be regarded as akin to a decision to allow the limitation period to expire,“such that any prejudice occasioned [to the liquidator] by the making of that decision might be said to be self-inflicted”.InReOctaviarLtd Pty Limited (recs andmgrsapptd) (in liq)(2012) 271 FLR 413; [2012] NSWSC 1460at [64],Black Jobserved that the time limitations insection 588FFreflect a recognition that the quality of justice may deteriorate where there is delay andthere will be a need that potential defendants be made aware of claims against them within a reasonable time and the loss of the ability to make a relevant claim can be justified as providing certainty to persons who had had dealings with the company.His Honour saidthat:“The Court should consider whether theLiquidators’have diligently pursued the object of disposing of the proceedings in a timely way; used, or could reasonably have used, available opportunities under the rules or otherwise to avoid delay; and reasonably implemented the practice and procedure of the Court with the object of eliminating any lapse of time between the commencement of the proceedings and their final determination... TheLiquidators bear the onus of demonstrating why itwasjust and fair that the time limit prescribed by s 588FF(3) of the Corporations Act should not apply...”The three-year period specified in s 588FF(3)(a) of the Act is an“essential aspect”of the voidabletransactionsregime:Gordon vTolcherin his capacity as liquidator ofSenafieldPty Ltd (in liq)(2006) 231 CLR 334; [2006] HCA 62 at [40]. In determining what is fair and just, regard must be had to the reason for the imposition of the limitation, both as applicable to limitation periods generally and those relevant to s 588FF(3)(b):New Cap Reinsuranceat [54];Clarecastleat [129].As regards the reason for limitation periods generally, McHugh J made the following observations inBrisbaneSouthRegionalHealth Authority v Taylor(1996) 186 CLR 541 at 552-553; [1996] HCA 25(which were referred to inNew CapReinsuranceat [54]; andClarecastleat [130]):“First, as time goes by, relevant evidence is likely to be lost. Second, it is oppressive, even‘cruel’, to a defendant to allow an action to be brought long after the circumstances which gave rise to it have passed. Third, people should be able to arrange their affairs and utilise their resources on the basis that claims can no longer be made against them. Insurers, public institutions and businesses, particularly limited liability companies, have a significant interest in knowing that they have no liabilities beyond a definite period.…The final rationale for limitation periods is that the public interest requires that disputes be settled as quickly as possible.”As regards the reason for the limitation period in s 588FF, Hodgson JA observed inTolcherv Gordon(2005) 53 ACSR 442;[2005] NSWCA 135 at [3] that an important purpose of the limitation period is to make potential defendants aware of claims against them in a reasonable time. InBP v Brownat [112] and [114], Spigelman CJ said that:“There is, in my opinion, a broader public interest to be served by allowing persons who have had dealings with companies which become insolvent to conduct their commercial affairs with a degree of certainty about their exposure to having past transactions unravelled.…The commercial and economic life of the community is sometimes better served by allowing the loss to lie where it falls, so that all concerned may proceed with a high degree of certainty as to their financial position. The passage of time, even the passage of three years, can be seen to legitimately alter the balance of conflicting interests in this regard.”However, Spigelman CJ noted that, in considering what is fair and just in all the circumstances, the requirement of commercial certainty on the part of those who have had past dealings with the corporation is to be balanced against the conflicting interests of the creditors of the company in having the company’s affairs properly investigation and administered in an orderly fashion:BP v Brownat [171].TheInterestedParties placed reliance on White J’s observation inNew Cap Reinsuranceat [55] that the issue of prejudice“ordinarily should be of paramount importance”. Nonetheless, it remains the case thateach application must be determined not by reference to whether certain factors are present or absent, but in the exercise of the discretion provided by s 588FF(3), on acase by casebasis, and having regard to the particular circumstances of each case.ConsiderationIn his affidavit in support of the application for an extension, the Liquidator stated as follows:“134.As at the date of this affidavit, I consider that I do not have in my possession complete and adequate books and records of the Company despite my comprehensive attempts to obtain such.135.On that basis, I consider that there are examinable affairs of the Company that each of the Director and Domenic Carbone may have information in relation to and that ought to be examined on oath. I also consider that there are grounds to seek notices of production to each of the Director and Domenic Carbone for the reasons set out above.136.As such, I have now determined to seek the examination of the Director pursuant to s.596A of the Corporations Act and Domenic Carbone pursuant to s.596B of the Corporations Act. I am informed and verily believe that my solicitors will conduct these examinations on a speculative basisin order toassist me.137.Exhibited to me atSF3:84is a proposed Originating Process(the Draft OP)that I intend to file seeking orders for production and for the above proposed examination.138.The purpose of these examinations is to obtain full and proper copies of the books and records of the Company and to examine the above in relation to the affairs of the Company and its transactions leading up to its liquidation.139.However, I am unable to complete these examinations and identify potential antecedent transactions before the expiry of the relevant limitation period.”As noted above, the Liquidator estimated that he would require“an additional 12 months to conduct the proposed examinations, seek advice and commence proceedings as required”.Delay and explanation for delayTheInterestedParties did not challenge the Liquidator’s conclusion that he had a basis fordecidingto conductpublicexaminations, or the reasons why he wanted to conduct examinations. Further, they did not raise any issue about the scope of the proposed examinations, as set out in the Liquidator’s affidavit; or about the scope of the documents to be sought by the examination summonses; or about the Liquidator’s estimate of the time requiredin order toconduct those examinations, seek advice and commence proceedings.Instead, theInterestedParties contended that the matters upon which the Liquidator relied in concluding that there was a need to conduct examinations(relating primarily to the lack of adequate financial records, despite extensive attempts to obtain such records) were matters known to him in early 2023.By that time, he had been informed by Ms Carbone, PwC and Natoli that they had no further books and records of Futurepower to produce in response to the various notices that had been issued and requeststhat had been made by the Liquidator, and shortly afterwards the Liquidator received scanned copies of Barclays’files. The Liquidator accepted that he had in mind commencing examinations in around 2023 and, as outlined above, he indicated to each of Mr Carbone and Ms Carbone that he might do soaroundthat time.TheInterestedParties submitted thatthe Liquidator had not given any explanation for his failure tocommenceexaminations at some point in time shortly after his documentary enquiries came to an end in early 2023. They further submitted that, if the Liquidator had commenced examinations in early 2023, then,having regard to the 12-month estimate which he now provides to the Court for completingexaminations, obtainingadviceand commencingany proceedings, he would have concluded all such steps prior tothe expiry of the three-year limitation period (on 4 February 2024).I accept that there is some force in these criticisms. The Liquidator does appear to have reached a point, by early 2023, where he had ceasing making further requests for documents or information from Ms Carbone, M&S,Barclaysor the accountants. He was aware, from that point, that there were gaps in the information and documents which had been producedandthat itwouldbe necessary,in order toinvestigate further the affairs of Futurepower, to conduct examinations. Yet the Liquidator did not take this step at that time. No explanation was provided for this delay, other than the Liquidator indicating, in answer to a question in cross-examination, that in 2023 he was awaiting the outcome of theLEC Proceedings.The Liquidator did not identify any reason why the decisionwhether or notto conduct examinations was dependent on the outcome of theLEC Proceedings.While those proceedings may have had an impact on whether, and when, and for what amount, the Liquidator may be able to realise Futurepower’s interest in the Property, the Liquidator acknowledged in cross-examination that funding was not a factor in his decision whether to bring,orwhen to bring, any examination proceedings. Although the Liquidator has now received creditors’approval for entry into an agreement to fund examinations, the Liquidator had determined, at the time the extension application was made, to proceed with examinations on an unfunded basis and his solicitors had agreed to act for him in relation to those examinations on a speculative basis.While it is regrettable that the Liquidator did not move with greater dispatch to undertake examinations and form a view on the availability of any claims in respect of voidable transactions prior to the expiry of the period set out in s 588FF(3)(a) of the Act, this delay is not a matter which disentitles the Liquidator from obtaining an extension under s 588FF(3)(b), but rather is a factor to be considered when determining whether, in all the circumstances of this case, an extension would be fair and just.In that regard, the following circumstances are relevant.The evidence establishes that the Liquidator was not sitting on his hands from the time of hisappointment, butwas instead pursuing multiple lines of inquiry in seeking to obtain information and recordsrelatingto the business affairs of Futurepower.The steps taken by the Liquidator included issuing notices, and making requestsfor information, to Futurepower’s director (Ms Carbone), solicitor (Mr Carbone), joint venture partner (M&S), accountants (Natoli) and tax advisers (PwC). In some cases, there were extensive delays in answering the Liquidator’s requests, requiring follow-up by the Liquidator and repeated requests; in some cases, the Liquidator’s requests were refused outright (for example, the request for M&S’s books and records and the request for Ms Carbone’s personal bank records); and in the case of Barclays, the production of its files relating to Futurepower wascompleted only some two years after it was first requested, after extensive correspondence with the Liquidator.When the Liquidator raised the prospect of conducting examinations in early 2023, Ms Carbone’s solicitorssaid that the Liquidator should focus on the Director LoanProceedings, which were then on foot (and in which the Liquidator had not yet filed evidence), rather than conducting public examinations. Following this, the Liquidator proceeded to file and serve Futurepower’s evidence in those proceedings.When the Liquidator indicated that he was considering examinations in early 2023, he had not yet received copies of all of Barclays’files. Having received such material in May 2023, he was thenin a positionto review that material and determine whetherto undertake public examinations. By late 2023, the Liquidator had determined to take this step, and gave instructions for the drafting of an originating process for the commencement of the examination proceedingsand alsofor the drafting of examination summonsesand orders for production, addressed to each of Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone. Those documents were drafted by January 2024 and the Liquidator brought this application on 1 February 2024, attaching those draft documents to his affidavit in support.Having regard to those matters, while I accept that the Liquidator could haveand, in light of the approaching end of the s 588FF(3)(a) period, should have moved with greater urgency to be in a position to commence examinations, I am satisfied that the Liquidator has, in the period since this appointment,conscientiouslytaken stepsto investigate the affairs of Futurepower and has faced a number of obstaclesand setbacksin gaining access to documents. Further, when those attempts toobtaindocuments had come to an end, by around May 2023, the Liquidator did take steps to form a view on whether or not to bring examination proceedings and gave instructions for the requisite documents to be drafted. The period of aroundsevenmonths between the provision of those documents and the preparation of examination summonses,while longer than desirable,was not soextensiveas to lead me to conclude that theLiquidator has not been diligently performing his duties, particularly in circumstances where he has been taking steps in other litigation relating to Futurepower in that period.TheInterestedParties placed some reliance on the Liquidator’s report to creditors dated 7 June 2021. In that report, the Liquidator estimated that he expected the winding up of Futurepower to end in“6 months to less than 1 year”.At the time this estimate was provided, the Liquidator was entitled to proceed on the basis that he would, in due course, receive information and documents in response to the various enquiries he had made, and that this material would be provided in a timely manner. However, as matters transpired, he engaged in correspondence with Ms Carbone, Mr Carbone, Natoli and PwC for another one to two years after this statement was made, anda number ofhis requests for documentation remain unanswered (such as those in relation to documents held by M&S and Ms Carbone’s personal bank records).In his June 2021 report, the Liquidatorsought funding proposals from creditors for, among other things,“Examination of the Company’s Director [Ms Carbone] and solicitor [Mr Carbone]”, including for seeking“legal advice as to the likely success of any potential claims”.The Liquidatorrequested that creditors contact his office within 14 days if they required further information about funding or an assignment of a right to sue, andstated(in bold font):“If no funding proposals or interest in assigning a right to sue are forthcoming, I will finalise the winding up without any further notice to creditors.”I do not place much significance on this statement of intention, made at an early stage in the liquidation and, in particular, beforethe Liquidator had received, let alone reviewed, documents relating to the affairs of Futurepower.Further,it is not known whether, at the time this statement was made,the Liquidator’ssolicitors had agreed to act in any examinations on a speculative basis.That would plainly have been a significant matter for the Liquidator in determiningwhether or notto proceed with any examinations in the absence of funding.There is limited explanation by the Liquidator, in his second affidavit of 12 July 2024, regarding any steps taken by him in the period following the filing of his application for an extension order.He deposedthat he has taken steps, sinceearly February 2024, to secure a litigation funder for the public examinations, and that this led to a funding agreement which was provided to the creditors for their approval (such approval being given after the date of his affidavit). In addition, he deposed that he has continued todeal withthe ongoingDirector Loan Proceedings.As noted above,Ms Carbone filed her evidence in those proceedings in March 2024, aftera number ofdelays, following which there was an unsuccessfulmediation.Having regard to those matters, I consider that, although the Liquidator could and should have proceeded with greater urgency and, if he had done so, may have been able to complete examinations and form a view about any voidable transaction claims prior to 4 February 2024, the Liquidator did diligently perform his duties during the three-year period following his appointment and, in particular:devoted significant effort in that period to pursuing various lines of enquiry relating to the affairs of the company;experienced delays in getting documents and information in response to those enquiries;after exhausting those enquiries,was in a position where there remained gaps in his knowledge about the company’s affairs; andhaving formed that view, and in circumstances where there was other ongoing litigation involving the company, took steps to ensure that material was drafted for any examination proceedings before bringing an application for an extension order under s 588FF(3).Merits of claimsThe Liquidator seeks a“shelf”order, that is, an order extending time for the bringing of any application under s 588FF(1) of the Act, without identifying anyparticular transactionswhich may be the subject of such an application. The High Court held, in the passage ofFortressCreditwhich is quoted above, that such an order may be made in the exercise of the discretion under s 588FF(3).The basis for the extension is to enable the Liquidator to conduct public examinations to consider what claims may be available. In that context, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the merits of any proposed claims:New Cap Reinsuranceat [52]-[55].Prejudice to InterestedPartiesI accept theInterestedParties’submissions that any extension order unders588FF(3)(b) will give rise to uncertainty whether any claims will be brought against them. Further, any such uncertainty is increased in circumstances where (as here) a“shelf”order is sought, such that it is not known which transaction or transactions might subsequently be the subject of any voidable transaction claim.Each of Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone gave evidence to the effect that any ongoing uncertainty about these matters would place them under increased stress, especially in circumstanceswhere each of them has the ongoing medical conditions described in their evidenceand where they are parties to the ongoing Director Loan Proceedings and LEC Proceedings.The medical conditions described in the evidence of Ms Carbone and Mr Carbonehave existed since before the Liquidator was appointed. Those medical conditions, and the treatment for them,are not said to prevent or hamper the ability of Mr Carbone and Ms Carbone to participate in those otherProceedings. This is not a situation where a person would have been able to participate fully in a proceeding if it had been brought against him or her at aparticular point in time, but is,as a result ofa supervening medical condition, unable to do so when the proceeding is brought at a much later period in time.While it may be accepted that stress and anxiety are increased in circumstances where a number of proceedings are on foot, the position would not have been significantly different if the Liquidator hadcommenced examination proceedings in 2023, as theInterestedParties nowcontendhe should have done. Further, the Liquidator has indicated that the examination proceedings may go aheadwhether or notthe extension unders588FF is granted, in order to investigate any other available claims. Accordingly, I do not consider that an order extending the time for the bringing of an application under s 588FF(1) of the Act willcause, of itself,significant stress and anxiety to Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone additional to that which they are already experiencingas a result ofthe ongoing proceedings, their health conditions and the prospect of any examinations by the Liquidator.TheInterestedParties also submitted that if a“shelf”extension order is made, they will suffer prejudice because the scope of any claim that may be made unders588FF is unknown and therefore it may be the case that, by the time such claim is commenced, relevant documents have been lost or memories have faded.I accept that, where there is significant delay in bringing proceedings, prejudice may exist“without the parties or anybody else realisingthatit exists”:Brisbane South Regionalat551. For example, by the time a claim is brought, a party may be unable to recall that he or she previously possessed a documentwhich was relevant to the dispute, let alone what the content or significance of that document might have been for the pleaded issues in the case.However, as the Liquidator submitted, any such“presumed prejudice”by reason ofany extension of the period for bringing an application under s 588FFis somewhat ameliorated by thefollowing matters:from a time shortly after Futurepower went into liquidation, the Liquidator has been making detailed requests for information and documents to Ms Carbone, MrCarboneand the company’s accountants;the Liquidator has outlined in his affidavit,and hisCounselhasoutlined in submissions, matters whichthe Liquidatorwould seek to investigateinsuchexaminations; andthe Liquidator has provided, in support of this application, draftorders for productionwhich identify the specific documents which he will be seeking to have producedby each of Ms Carbone and Mr Carbonefor the purposes of those examinations.The Interested Parties have not, by reference to the list of documents sought inthose draft orders for production, identified any documents or categories of documents which they previously held, but no longer hold, due to the passage of time.Further, given that MsCarbone and MrCarbone were aware that claims might be brought against them under s 588FF at any time up to 4 February 2024 and were aware before that date (by service of the current application) that the Liquidator was intending to apply for an extension of the period for any such claim, it could not be said, and theInterestedParties did not say, that they had destroyed any relevant documents held by them in the belief that the time for any such claim had passed.Extension OrderHaving regard to the principles and matters outlined above, I am satisfied that it is just and fair in all the circumstances of this case that an extension order be made. Although there has been some delay on the part of the Liquidator,thishas occurred in a context where he hasgenerally been, over the past three years, diligent inseeking to obtain information from relevant parties about the affairs of Futurepower and has experiencedsome significant delays andsetbacks inhis enquiries, andthis has occurredin a context where there hasbeen other ongoing litigation involving the companyand relating to the Property. Although an extension would cause uncertainty and, with such uncertainty, additional stress for theInterestedParties, they would, to some degree, be subject to such uncertainty and stress irrespective of whether an extension orderweremade, having regard to the ongoing proceedings in which they are involved and the fact that the Liquidator may conduct examinations whether or not an extension order is made. Further, I need to balance the interest of the InterestedParties in havingcommercialcertainty regardingwhether or notclaims may be bought against them against the interest of the creditors in theaffairs of Futurepower being properly investigated and administered in an orderly fashion.That leaves the question of the form of the order.The Liquidator sought an extension of 12 months from the date that the extension order was made. As outlined above, this was said to be theLiquidator’sestimate of the time requiredin order toconduct examinations, obtain advice and commence any claim.The Liquidator did not provide any breakdown of the steps required to be taken, or the time necessary for each,in order tosupport this estimate. However,theInterestedParties did not, in cross-examination,challenge the Liquidator’s evidence of the time requiredfor these steps. Nor did theInterestedPartiesadvance any submission to the effect that, if an extension order were granted, it should be made for a shorter period.In addition, I am mindful that the Director LoanProceedings arebeing heard in December 2024 and that Mr Carbone raised a concern, in his affidavit, that if an extension order is made, it would potentially divert the attention of Mr Carbone and Ms Carbone away from, and disrupt their preparation for, the defence of the prosecution brought against them in theLEC Proceedings.I am also mindful of the evidence given by Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone about theirhealth conditions and, in particular, themajor surgery which Ms Carbonerequires and the extended period of therapy which is expected to follow such surgery.Having regard to those matters,I am satisfied that an order should be made in the terms sought, that is, extending the period for the bringing of any application unders588FF(1) by a further 12 months from the date of the order. This will allow examinations to be scheduled having regard to any commitments of Ms Carbone and Mr Carbone in the Director LoanProceedingsand in theLEC Proceedings,and alsohaving regard to their health conditions and any ongoing treatment for those conditions.Conclusion and ordersFor the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that it is fair and just, in all the circumstances of this case, to make the extension order sought by the Liquidator.In written submissions, the Liquidator contended that, if theInterestedParties opposed the application, they should be ordered to pay the Liquidator’s costs. I do not consider it appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, for such an order to be made. The Liquidator was seeking an extension of time in circumstances where there were criticisms raised by theInterestedParties regarding delay and the lack of an adequate explanation for that delay. I accepted, in part, those criticisms, and concluded that the Liquidator could have and should have proceeded with greater urgency, but was nonetheless satisfied, having regard toall ofthe circumstances of this case, that the extension order should be made.Given that is so, I consider that the appropriate order is that the Liquidator’s costsof this extension applicationbecosts in the liquidationof Futurepower.Accordingly, I make the following orders:Order pursuant to section 588FF(3)(b) of theCorporations Act 2001(Cth) that the period during which the Plaintiff may make any application pursuant to section 588FF(1) be extended to15August 2025.Order that the Plaintiff’s costs of the application be costs in the liquidation of Futurepower Developments Pty Ltd (in liq).**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

Of Christine’s six younger siblings,two have sided with her, namely WilliamMcNameeand SallyCollignon.Christine’s other four siblings, PeterMcNamee, StephenMcNamee,JohnMcNamee(John Junior), and Philippa Hardyclaim that Christine is liable to repay$1,250,000 to the first plaintiff, LorebrayPty Ltd, the trustee ofa family trust,theMcNamee Property Trust.Christine accepts she received$1,250,000 advancedtoher in two instalmentsby another familytrustee company,J & MMcNamee Holdings Pty Ltd,thetrustee of the Red Hill Property Trust. On16December 2013, $250,000 was advanced, and on 18 March 2015, $1,000,000 was advanced.The plaintiffs’claim in relation to some other advances made to Christine in 2013 have been withdrawn on the basisthatthe limitation periodhaslapsed.At the time of the paymentsin dispute and up until recently,bothtrustee companies werecontrolled by their parents, and there is nodispute that the payments were made at the direction of their parents.The plaintiff siblingswere granted leave to continue the proceedings on behalf of Lorebray:Lorebray Pty Ltd v Liddy[2022] NSWSC 1633at[70]; see also [45]–[47](Henry J).Christine acceptsthatshe received the payments, butdefendsthe claimand cross-claims on the basis thatthe advances were gifts.If the advances were gifts, the parties agree thatthe payments weremade in reduction of a loan owed byLorebraytoJohn Seniorand Margaret.For the reasons that follow, Iconsiderthe advances were loans.Relevant principlesTheplaintiffs bear the onus of proving that the payments to Christine were made by way of loan, and not gift:Heydon v Perpetual Executors, Trustees and Agency Co (WA) Ltd(1930) 45 CLR 111at113(Gavin Duffy J, Rich, Starke and Dixon JJ agreeing).Mere payment of money does not charge the payment with a particular character.A loan is a contract, where the payer advances money in consideration of the recipient’s promise to repay:Schmierer v Taouk[2004] NSWSC 345at[43] (White J, as his Honour then was).There is no need for awrittenagreement, or even for an express agreement.An obligation to repay may arise by implication (including by implication from past dealings between the parties).

An obligation to repay may be implied where funds are provided in response to an express or implied request;implication is context-dependent:CBRE (V) Pty Ltd v City Pacific Ltd (in liq)[2022] NSWCA 54at[32]–[36] (Leeming JA, Bell CJ and Brereton JA agreeing).To some extent,the plaintiffs’case is one of inferenceas to intention.InLuxton v Vines(1952) 85 CLR 352at358,Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto JJstatedthat the process of drawing an inference requires the circumstances to give rise to a“reasonable and definite inference”, and those circumstances:…must do more than give rise to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is mere matter of conjecture...Because Christine brings a positive casein her cross-claimthat the advances were gifts,it might also be saidthatshe bears the onus of proof for her case.However,the utility in Christine’s cross-claim,inseeking a declaration of thestate of affairs that the plaintiffs must overcome to be successful,is not apparent. If the plaintiffs fail, then the advances must be gifts.It may be thatChristine filed her cross-claimprimarilybecause she sought alternative declaratory relief, which is considered further below.I note thatin written submissions,Christine’scounselsought to rely on the“presumption”of advancement in support of Christine’s position. However, that argument was abandoned at hearing, and so it is unnecessary to consider whether that so-called presumption applies to the present case,which does not involve a claim based on resulting trust.Instead, it is possible to determine the parties’intentions.John Senior and Margaret’s intentionsJohn Senior was a successful businessman and engineer.He and Margaret accumulated a large amount of wealth that was invested in various ways, includingthrough various companies andin the Red Hill Property Trust and the McNamee Property Trust.Over at least 20 years before John Senior’s death, heand Margaret caused money to be advanced to their childrenin various circumstances and in various sums, often in large sums of hundreds of thousands of dollars.Regularly,advancesto their childrenwererecordedas“loans”bybookkeepers who were responsible for the records and booksofthe“McNamee Group”including theMcNamee Property Trust and Red Hill Property Trust.The bookkeepersmade those records on instructions from John Senior.It is not in dispute that the parents also advanced some money to their children as giftsthat were not recorded in the companies’accounts.From2002 to 2020,MrGavinHiltonwas the trust companies’external accountant. Hepreparedvariousfinancialdocumentation for thefamily trusts. I accept his unchallenged evidence that he prepared tax returns, annual financial statements and a summary of“loans”to related parties,including theirchildren,on the express instructions of John Senior and Margaret,andrelying on the bookkeeper’s records.I accept that thegeneral ledgers of the McNamee Property Trust for the 2014 and 2015 financial years record each of the advances in questionas a“Loan”;as a debit against Christine’s loan account.I accept that Mr Hilton did not carry out any auditing process, and instead created the companies’financial statements and tax returns based on instructions.While he“ordinarily”asked the internal bookkeeper or John Senior about any large payments, including the payments to Christine,hedid notenquire as to the terms of any“loans”he wasasked to recordandhe did not ask for documentary proof of any loans. Instead, hetrusted the categorisation of the advances as instructed by John Senior and Margaret.Mr Hilton accepted that, hadhe been instructed that the advances were not loans, but instead repayments of investments, he would have prepared the financial documentation differently.The same would follow if,in truth,what was recorded as a loan amounted to the parents drawing down on the loans owed by the trustee companies to them, which they then gifted their children.Further,Mr Hilton gave evidence ofwitnessing a disagreement between John Senior and Margaret in 2017. JohnSeniorwanted to updatetheirwills and Mr Hilton’s evidence is that heindicated to them:I said that, if they were going to update their wills, they needed to deal with the loan accounts (by which I meant the loan accounts to the children). …I recall that John and Margaret specifically discussed the payments to Christine in the course of this disagreement. Margaret stating to the effect that money to Christine was for her time of need referring to the payments in FY2014 and FY2015. Margaret said that they “gave” Christine the money because she needed it at the time. She did not use the words “gift” or “gifted”. John’s response to the effect that yes she needed it then but it needs to be recorded so all the others get the same benefit. John’s position being like most parents to treat all the children equally over time.InAugust2017, Mr Hiltonprepared an email to another accountant concerninga meeting with John Senior and Margaret, in which the two debatedin a similar waythe future of the“loans”to their children:I meet with John and Peg in early July to go through the attached family loan summary.Peg wants to wipe all the loans clean so that no one owes any money back. John has a different view. They argued for a while and then I left them to discuss it further.Phoned John earlier this week and he is still non-committal. So we have no clear resolution either way. He is putting his head in the sand rather than make a decision.Mr Hilton was not cross-examined on this evidence.I considerMr Hilton’saffidavitevidenceabout the parents’disagreement about the treatment of the“loans”andthis email compelling.It is evidence from an independent professional witness that his clients were discussingexistingloans and whether theywanted themto be forgiven. I consider Mr Hilton was an honest witness and I accept his evidence.Based on the aboveevidenceof Mr Hilton, I accept that John Senior and Margaret intended the advances to berecorded asloans, whether or not they were later forgiven.For completeness, I note that there was a vague attempt at discrediting thecompanies’financial records inMr Hilton’sevidence, for example,on the basis that they were not signed. Further, Christine submitted that it was onlyin 2019 amidst an escalating familial dispute about thefamily trusts that documents were created to itemise the putative loans said by the plaintiffs to be owing by Christine and her siblings.However:The practice ofthe McNamee Group’s accountantsrecording“loans at call”commenced before 2002and continued until at least 2018, as shown by the balance sheets showing the assets and liabilities of the McNamee Property Trust covering the years ending 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2018 which contain a full breakdown of“Loans At Call”.Mr Hiltonrecorded loans to the siblings at John Senior’s instructionevery yearfrom 2002until 2019, and with Margaret’s apparent approval from 2012 to 2018, as detailed further below.Mr Hiltondid not retain signed versions of financial documents, and he submitted the signed tax returns to the tax office.Mr Hiltonwas removed as the trusts’accountant in 2020 andno longer had access to all the companies’records.Christinealsosubmitted thatthe Court should afford“very limited”weight to the companies’financial documents because theputative loans were not recorded in the financial records ofJ & MMcNamee Holdings,which wasthe entity that advanced the payments.The plaintiffs’explanation for this was thatthe payments were accounted for by both Lorebray andJ & MMcNamee Holdings as payments made by Lorebray out of the credit balance of its loan account withJ & MMcNamee Holdings.Each was allocated in the management accounting system ofJ & MMcNamee Holdings to an“Account”described as“Loan–McNamee Property Trust”, and treated by Lorebray as having reduced the indebtedness to it ofJ & MMcNamee Holdings.I accept the plaintiffs’explanation.I do not consider anything turns on the way the advancesto Christinewere allocated within the trust companies’financial records, in circumstances where they were both controlled by the parentsand where Mr Hilton acted on their instructions. There is nothing surprising about family trusts being operated together and for inter-company loans to be recorded with the movement of money in accordance with the intention of those in control, with the assistance of an expert accountant.That is consistent withamanagement report for the year ended 30 June 2001 prepared by KPMG, whichrefers to“Movements in related loans”between the McNamee family companies and trustsand family members.There isalsoother evidence that John Senior referred to various advances to his children as“loans”, even though the siblings were not privy to the way the trust companies recorded and accounted for advances to each of them.Even thoughbased on the above and the consideration of Margaret’s evidence below,I am satisfied that John Senior and Margaretintended theadvances to berecorded asloansand intended them to be loansrepayable when they called on them, thatis only half the question. There must have beena meeting of the minds between Christine and her parents in relation to theterms upon which theparticular advanceswere made and received.Christine’s intentionsI note here that the evidence of Christine’s various siblings about the interactions they had with their parents concerning advances of moneyto themis largely irrelevant. Even if it could be demonstrated that John Senior and Margaret had a tendency to“loan”money to their childrenand require repayment,ortogift money to them, the only relevant inquiry here is whether they loanedthe two advancesto Christineand that shepromised,whether expressly or impliedly,to repaythe money.In any event, the siblings did not give consistent evidence.For example, PhilippaHardystated that she accepted moneyshe was given by her parentswas repayable, but did not give evidence that her parents informed her of the terms of any loan agreement. Further, she received other moneyfrom her parents, not referred to in her affidavit, such as $2.6million as bridging finance, which it appears she did repay.John Junioraccepted thatbefore 2015,he received over $1.7millionfrom his parents, but did not give evidence as to whether that money was a loan or gift or related to an investment.Peter gave evidence about what is recorded in the 2019Lorebrayloan schedulewhich suggestedhe was liable forloans ofover $329,000.His evidence was that while thatschedulerecorded loans against his name,he considered the loan was not repayable,becausehisother siblingswere given money, that“even[ed] up what was given to John [Junior] and [Peter] in the 90s”.I consider that evidence consistent with the evidence Peter gave in2021in proceedings before Black J.In those proceedings, Peter initiallystated that he“wasn’t sure”whether John Senior wanted him to repay the $329,000 to Lorebray. However,hesubsequently corrected his evidence, asserting that hedid not think the loan was repayable,sincemoney had been advanced to his sisters to“compensate for the money that the boys [iePeterand his brothers] had got years earlier”.Hecould not offer any explanation as to why the amount in question remained on the loan schedule.I consider thatPeter’ssubjective belief of the legal characterisation ofhis“loan”is not relevant totheparticularadvances to Christine. It has not been suggested that the loan schedule records the universe of financial advances to the various siblings. However, it does record John Senior and Margaret’s understanding oftheadvancesmadeto each childthat were expressed to Mr Hiltonas having been advanced as loans.Sallywas not required for cross-examination. Shegave evidencethat she was unaware that anyof her parents’advances to her were loans.She states that her parents told her that the girl siblings would be given similar amounts as the boy siblings to“even up”distributionsbetween them. However, herevidence does not descend into detail aboutthe particular advances to Christine, and therefore I do not considerher evidence assistseither party.However, all the siblings gave evidence that their parents were generous. Various of them spoke oftheir parents indicating that they wanted to treat their children“equally”and thatadvanceswouldbe“adjusted”at some point.None of the siblings were involved in thefinancial decisions of their parents, including in relation to their family trusts.It is quite possible that John Senior and Margaretconsidered forgivingall the loans on their deaths, and dividingtheir estates in some way to give effect to some“adjustment”.However, again, that is not the issue here.To find thattheadvances to Christine are loans, it is necessary to be satisfied thatshe understood the money was being advanced on the basis that it would be repaid and she accepted it on that basis.Christine denies the advances were loans, and positively asserts in her cross-claim that they were gifts.To determine that issuerequires an assessment of herevidence and credibility.Each advance must be considered separately.The plaintiffs submitted that Christine was not candid with the Courtgenerallyand her evidence ought not be accepted for various reasonsconsideredbelow.At the outset,I note thatChristine’s counsel indicatedto the Court before Christine gave evidencethat,because of a medical conditionthat can cause tremors,Christine may need to take a break during cross-examination. The nature of the medical condition was not in evidence.For example,there was no evidence thather medical conditionimpacted her memory at all. Christine did not ask for a breakduring cross-examinationand did not take upanoffer of a break.I do not accept Christine’s evidenceaboutthe advancesfor the following reasons.First, while her affidavit asserted that she“never”received any moneyfrom her parentsby way of loan, that was clearly not the case.Documents demonstrated that in 1999,her parentsloanedher$15,000from Lorebray,which was repaid with interest of $500.The documents do not reveal a formal loan agreement or specific terms, however, $15,000 was transferred to Christine at her father’s direction, and it was repaid together with $500 described as“interest”. Christine stated in cross-examination that she had no recollection of that loan, repeatedly stating“I don’t recall this at all”or“I have no memory of that”.Further, in 2011, Christine received an advance of $65,000from Lorebrayat her father’s direction.At the time,Christine sent facsimiles to her father’s bankerwho wasorganising the advance, including:We have undertaken to sell [our home] and are currently in discussion with a number of local real estate agents with the intention of appointing a principal selling agent.…I am also pleased to confirm that the advance of $65,000 will be repaid from the settlement of the sale of the house.In cross-examination, Christine could not recall any of the following:Receiving that$65,000from Lorebray.Offering to pay back the $65,000, including from the property sale proceeds.Speaking with various real estate agents.Even considering selling her homein March 2011.Again, her answer to almost every question was“I don’t recall”.There is no reason to assume thatin 2011,Christine was attempting to misleadher father’sbankerin indicating that she was selling her home and repaying the$65,000advance. Ittells against her credit that she claimed to haveno recollection of the significant event of obtaining a valuation of her home and speaking with agents to put the property on the marketonly13 years ago.Secondly, in Christine’s cross-claim,her primary allegation is that the advances in question were gifts. However, within the cross-claim in three places,an alternative is pleaded, namely, that the advances werediscretionarydistributions from theRed Hill PropertyTrust. Christine accepted in cross-examination thatthere was no evidence that the advances were in fact distributions and that she knew thatthealternativeallegation in the cross-claim was“wrong”.Her evidence was that“I don’t recall ever believing that they were discretionary distributions from a trust”.Christine accepted that she had givenGilbert + Tobin instructions for the preparation of the cross-claim.However,inrelation tothe allegation about thealleged trustdistribution,her evidence was:A: …I don’t recall that. I don’t recall telling them that that was correct…Q: As you sit in the witness box now, do you say it’s your evidence to her Honour, speaking about the events of 2020, that you simply have no explanation as to why that allegation appears in your pleading?A: Yes.Q: It’s a complete mystery to you?A: Yes.…Q: … I want to suggest to you … that in July 2020, you were prepared to make an allegation that you knew to be untrue. Can I suggest that to you?A: No, I didn’t do it. I didn’t, I didn’t –Q: Can I suggest to you, you made the allegation in July 2020 with a view to try to improve your chances of defending this court case and knowing the allegation to be untrue?A: No, I didn’t ever do that.No submission was made by Christine’s counsel about this evidence, including the failure of Christine to abandonat any timethat part of the cross-claimshe knew was“wrong”.Again, it is difficult to accept that Christine had no knowledge of that part of the cross-claim prepared only 4 years ago, when she accepted it was prepared by solicitors on her instructions.Thirdly, in relation to the 2013and 2015advances, Christine’s affidavit evidence differed to some extent from her evidence in cross-examination. Her affidavit evidenceconcerning the 2013 advancewas:[on or around the dates of the 2013 advances] I recall having conversationswith my parents. Although I cannot now recall specifically what was said during those conversations,I do recall that my father said something along the lines of “we’re going to give you some money”.At no stage during these conversations did my mother or father ever say to me that any of this money was loaned to me or that they expected me to repay some or all of this money.Her affidavit evidence as to the March 2015 advance of $1 million is:During one of these visits to my parents’ home sometime later on Sunday,15 March 2015, I recall I was standing in between the kitchen and the dining room of my parents’ home in Middle Dural having a conversation with my mother, my father and David [her husband].During that conversation, my father said to David:“Do you have plenty of work at the moment?” David responded “Yes, however it’s a bit tight”. …Dad: We are going to give you some money. We have just given John a big lick of money.Me: Dad, that is very generous of you and Mum.Dad: I know you will use it wisely….Neither my mother or father ever said to me that some or all of these … payments were loans or that they expected me to repay some or all of them. The language each of them repeatedly used to describe these payments was that they were unsolicited gifts instigated by my parents. My parents never requested any repayment in relation to any of these transferred amounts.Because of John Senior’s death, there is no direct evidence from him about the alleged conversations. Margaret swore an affidavit that was read, but she was excused from being cross-examined because of her elderly and frail state.Her evidencedoes not descend into the detail of Christine’s andis considered further below.Except in repeating, almost as if a mantra, that there was never a loan, incross-examination,Christine either had forgotten everything or was not trying toassist in answeringquestions.Either way, I do not accept her evidence, in circumstances where there is other cogent evidence and a different reasonable explanation. Below is anexampleof Christine’s unconvincing evidence in cross-examination:Q. With respect, I'm asking you about the conversations in October and December 2013.A. I don't recall.Q. Do you have any recollection of a single word at all said on the occasion, on those three occasions?A. I don't have any direct, any absolute recollection, but I would have said, \"Thank you.\"Q. When you say to her Honour you \"would have said\"--A. Yeah.Q. --you don't have an actual recollection of saying that word, is that right?A. Not, not, no, not an actual recollection.…Q. With respect, I'm talking about - that's later. I'm just trying to keep your attention on the dates in October and December 2013, with respect to you.A. I don't recall, sorry.…Q. Let me come back a little bit. Your evidence to her Honour is you can't recall a single word that was said on those occasions, correct? Is that right?A. On the earlier ones, no, but on the latest one, the last one, I could.Q. The last one is the date in March--A. Correct.Q. --of what year?A. 2015.Q. Going back to the earlier ones in late 2013, if you can't recall, so you say, a single word said on that occasion, you certainly can't recall, can I suggest to you, that your dad said to you, \"We're going to give you some money\"?A. But I can.Q. Let's just - you accept you can't recall a single word said?A. On the, on, in the last one I can recall--Q. No, in October, December, 2013.A. No, I can't recall.Q. If you can't recall a single word said, you certainly can't recall the words you attribute to your dad, \"We're going to give you some money.\" You can't recall him saying those words, can you?A. I actually can.Q. So your evidence to her Honour is, on each of those three occasions in October and December 2013, of all of those conversations, those are the only words you say that you can recall? Is that right?A. I recall the words in relation to the million dollars.Q. Apart from that, you can't recall anything else said in October and December 2013, correct?A. I can't.…Q. I was asking you some questions about paragraph 18. You see in paragraph 18 you refer to those three meetings[in 2013]? You say, \"Although I cannot recall specifically what was said I do recall that my father said something along the lines of, 'We're going to give you some money.'\" What I want to suggest to you is that if you can't recall anything that was said on those occasions you're simply making it up when you said in this affidavit, \"We're going to give you some money\"?A. Well, I didn't make anything up.Christine proffered no explanation in evidence or submissionsas to whyshegave evidence on oath in her affidavit in 2023 about conversationsin 2013,where her father said“we’re going to give you some money”, but had no recollection of the words said when giving evidencea year laterin 2024.I donot accept that John Senior said to Christinethat“we’re going to give you some money”by way of gift. Instead, I consider Christine knew it was advanced as a loan and she accepted it on that basis,because her evidence is not reliable and crediblefor the reasons outlined.In relation to the March 2015 advance, Christine’s evidence did not fully explain the circumstances of the alleged conversation with her parents. Her evidence was thaton Sunday 15 March 2015,she was completely surprised by her parents telling her that she would receive money.While her evidence was that the $1 million she received was used to pay down her mortgage with her bank, she assertedin cross-examinationthat she did notrecallaskingher parents for financial assistance with her mortgage, nor for the particular sum of money.Her evidence in cross-examination includedthe following:Q. If your evidence is to be accepted, you never told your parents that your mortgage was in default, correct?A. I can't recall.Q. You just have no recollection one way or the other, is that right?A. Correct.Q. Would you say to her Honour that you might've said that?A. I may have, but I can't recall.Q. Was it in default at the time?A. I don't recall.Q. You never told, neither David nor you ever told your parents that youweren't able to pay the mortgage?A. I may have done.Q. At the time of this meeting?A. I don't recall. I don't - no, not - I don't recall.Q. You didn't ask your parents on your recollection that you needed any help, correct, with the mortgage?A. They probably - they, they knew that I had a - we had a decent mortgage.…Q. You certainly don't recall telling your parents in March 2015 that you and David needed help repaying the mortgage, did you?A. I don't recall.Christine’s evidence in cross-examination wavered as to whether her father mentioned the figure of $1 millionduring the conversationor not.She deniedthatshe askedher parentsfor the specific sum of money:Q. … I want to suggest to you that he said to you that he would lend you that money?A. Never. He did not say that.Q. You understood that when you got the money in the following week, that was the million dollars that had been discussed earlier with your dad, correct?A. We didn't discuss it. I didn't ask for it.Q. Did you ever ask him, on your version of events, why he plucked the figure of a million dollars out of the air?A. No, I didn't ask him that.…Q. It never crossed your mind to ask him why it was a million dollars?A. I don't think so. Not that, not that - I don't recall.However,documentaryevidence demonstrated that before the Sunday 15 March 2015 meeting,John Seniorhad been making arrangements to obtain $1 million for Christine.Based on an emailsent on 16 March 2015 toJohn Seniorfrom his business banker, it appears that the twohad met on Friday 13 March 2015 andJohn Seniorhadinstructedhis bankerthat“the Hardy’s”would pay $2.5million to J&M McNamee Holdings, andfrom that,$1 million would be paid to Christine.It appears likely that the $2.5 million was a repayment of the bridging finance given to Philippa. It seems highly unlikely that John Senior would have taken the steps outlined in theemail to obtain a specific sum of money for Christine for no reason and without her prompting and without any money being paid to any of the other 6 children.Despiteclaiming she could not rememberwhat was said at the 2013 meeting,and very little of what was said in 2015, and about other matters generally,Christine gave this evidence in cross-examination:Q: You knew in March 2015 that the million dollars was put to you as a loan by your mum and dad, correct?A: Not true.Q: And the payments in October and December 2013 were likewise described as loans by your mum and dad, correct?A: Not true I’m afraid.Similarly, she repeated that the million dollars“was never a loan”.I do not accept that evidence.Whether Christine expressly asked for the specific sum or not, I consider she sought assistance with her mortgage on the basis that the amount her parents caused to be advanced was by way of loan.John Juniorgave evidence, most of which was not challenged. Hesaw his father nearly every business daybetween 1998and2018.His evidence was thathisfather told him“on multiple occasions”that Christine was having a“cash crisis”and was having difficulty paying her mortgage. His evidence wasthat:My father never told me that he had decided to gift Christine $1 million to Christine. However, I recall him telling me on multiple occasions that …he had had to loan her money to help her meet her repayments.John Juniorwas not challenged on that evidence at all,and it was not suggested in submissions that it was incorrect,or ought not be accepted.John Juniordid frankly concede that some of his affidavit evidence was not completely correct,butI do not draw any adverse inference in relation to hisunchallengedevidenceabove.Therefore, I accept thatJohn Seniortold his accountant and his son,John Junior, that he had loaned money to Christine. He told his sonJohn Juniorthat the purpose ofa loan wasto assist Christine with her mortgage.That is consistent with the fact that Christine did usethe$1millionto reduce hermortgage with her mortgagee bank.I accept that Christine sought financial assistance from her parents to assist her with her mortgagein the form of a loan.In Christine’saffidavitevidence,she suggested that,had her parents told her that the advances were loans,she would not have accepted the money without seeking advice from various people. However,if the money was a loan from her parents to pay down her mortgage, it would not havehadthe effect of“taking on more debt”as she suggestedin her affidavit. Instead, she would be replacing $1 million of debt owed to the bank mortgagee with a debt to her parents, with whom she had a close relationship and who were“always willing to helpeach ofus(ie their children)”. There was an obvious benefitin owing an unsecured debt to her parentsin relation to her home,rather than a secured debt to a bank.Fourthly,the plaintiffs submit that Margaret’s affidavit evidence,that prima facie supports Christine,ought to be given little or no weightin this case: see egTurner v Windeyer[2005] NSWCA 73at[58] (Giles JA, Bryson JA agreeing).Margaret’s affidavitstates that the payments in question were authorised by her and her husband“as gifts”. She does­not give evidence about the authorisation process,the source of the funds, nor the particular conversationsat therelevanttimes.Her affidavitspeaks of her“practice”to discussundefined“material gifts”to her children with John Senior before making them. She continues:To thebest of my recollection, on each occasion money was given to Christine, my husband and I would discuss the amount Christine needed, or the amount that we wanted to gift her. In those discussions, the payments were always referred to as “gifts”.I did not have any discussion with my husband in which the payments were described as a “loan”. I never had any discussions with my husband regarding any of the money my husband and I gifted her being repaid by her at any time.It was also my practice to discuss the gifts that were being made with Christine at the time of the payments. In those discussions, I never said to Christine that she was required to repay the gifts. My husband never said that Christine had to repay the gifts.I did not intend or expect that Christine would, or should be required to, repay any of this money. From my discussions with my husband at the time, I believe that he had the same intention and expectation.There are notable weaknesses in this evidence:It was untested.It is vague as to the timing of the“gifts”and the particular“needs”of Christine that weresupposedlybeing met.It is contraryto Mr Hilton’s uncontested evidencethat Margaret attended meetingswith John Seniorfrom 2012 to 2018, at which thechildren’sloan schedules were discussed andapproved by both of them.She does not explain this inconsistency. Further,the contents ofthecompanies’financial documentationthat she approvedis not referred to anywhere by Margaret.Her bare denial of the 2017 disputebetween her and John Senior concerning whether the loans ought to be“wiped”is unconvincing in circumstances where Mr Hilton gave evidence of the conversation he witnessed, which isconsistent with his emailsentshortly thereafter.It is also inconsistent withJohn Junior’s evidence (detailed below) of Margaret being present at a fight between Christine and John Senior about Christine’s“loans”and Christine’s assertion that Margaret wanted them cleared.It is contrary towhat became apparent during Christine’scross-examination, that she did receive some moneyfrom her parentsby way of loan.In the circumstances, I give no weight to Margaret’s affidavit evidence.Fifthly,John Juniorgave evidence about a 2018 conversation that he overheard between his parents and Christine:Christine told my father that she and our mother had discussed “the loan accounts” and that mum wanted them “written off” so there would not be any “adjustments”. My mother did not say anything. My father immediately replied that the loan accounts couldn’t be written off, because adjustments had to be made so that we would all receive equal amounts. He told Christine that adjustments had to be made and that that was why he had already loaned her “all that money”. He said that it would not be fair for the loans to her, which represented an advance on her “share” to be written off now.Christine repeated that that was what our mother wanted. My father then asked my mother… directly whether she wanted their children to be treated equally. My mother said yes, but that she wanted to forget about everything before that day. My father responded that they couldn’t write off the loans because they had given too much to Christine and Bill, and he would never be able to make enough money to equalize the position if the loans were written off. He and Christine ended up having an argument, which resulted in my mother becoming upset and leaving the room.While it was suggested toJohn Juniorin cross-examination that the conversation did not occur and was“fabricated”, he denied that was the case, and he was notchallengedfurther. No reason was suggested to him as to why his evidence was false. Neither was thereanyevidence led byChristinethat contradictedJohn Junior’s evidence of the conversation; shedid not respond tohisaffidavitabout that conversation, despite aCourtorder permittingherto servereply evidencebefore the hearing.I find that the conversation took place as asserted byJohn Junior.I also considerthatChristinewas aware thather parents had recorded loans against her name,andthat she and her mother wereseeking to havethemforgivenby Lorebray.While there is no evidence of the particular“loans”being discussed in that conversation,by 2017, the trustee companies had recorded the advances to Christine in 2013 and 2015for multiple years.I consider Christine would have been aware of the large sums of money she had received from her parents, and understood they were loans, whichlikelymotivated herto arguewith her father.Further,John Junior’s evidence is consistent with Mr Hilton’s evidence about John Senior and Margaret’s attitudes around that time to the issue of the loans and the potential to have them forgiven.OtherThere are a few other submissions made by Christine as to why I ought not findthatthe advances were loans.I accept that the loans were informal and not in writing. I also accept that, in contrast to the 2013 and 2015 advances,the loans to Christine in 1999 and 2011were evidenced with some documents, although not in the form of a loan agreement.I do not accept that the informality of the arrangementsis fatal to the plaintiffs’claimin circumstances where I have found that Christine was awarethatthe advanceswerebeing provided by way of loan.Further, no submission was made by any party that all of John Senior’s documents had been investigatedin relation to Christine’sadvances.Christinealsosubmitted thata finding of a loan would be erroneous because it would be necessary for further findings to be made:namely,that it was intended that the moneysadvanced byJ & MMcNamee Holdingsto Christinewould reduce a separateinter-companyloan owedbyJ & MMcNamee HoldingstoLorebray, and thatthe moneysadvancedwould be repayable toLorebray rather thanJ & MMcNamee Holdings.As noted above,I do not considerthatthere is any issue with asophisticatedbusinessman,such asJohn Senior, organisingthe finances ofhis familycompaniesand trust entities in ways he considered fit with the assistance of his accountant.The relevantcontract from the perspective of the trust companies was directed by John Senior and Margaret.Christinefurthersubmitted that:…regard should be had to the history of John Snr and Margaret’s generosity over a 20 year period, the fact that the various payments or financial accommodations recorded in the general ledgers appear to rarely, if ever, have been called in.While regard may be had to the parents’generosity to their children, it cannotthereforebe concluded that every advance was a gift. Instead, it is necessary to consider the particular circumstances of the two advances to Christine.I note thatplaintiffs seek an adverse inference under the principle establishedbyJones v Dunkel(1959) 101 CLR 298because Christine failed to call her husband, David, as a witness in the case, in circumstances where he was allegedly a party to the relevant conversations in 2013 and 2015 with Christine’s parents.The principles governing the drawing of aJones v Dunkelinference were recently summarised by Stern JA (Ward P and Price AJA agreeing) inSSABR Pty Ltd v AMA Group Ltd[2024] NSWCA 175 at [158]–[165].I do not consider it is appropriate to draw an inference, in circumstances where David’s evidence was likely to be corroborative or cumulative, and Christine chose not to bring him forward: see egLing v Pang[2023] NSWCA 112at [28](Kirk JA,Leeming and Mitchelmore JJA agreeing).Conclusionand ordersBased on the above, I am satisfied that John Senior and Margaret intended the advances to be loans repayable at will.I am also satisfied that Christine was aware that the two advances were provided to her as loans that were to be recorded by her parentsagainst her“loan”balanceand repaid at will.In the circumstances, the appropriate orders are:A declaration that theamount of $250,000 advanced to the firstdefendant byJ & MMcNamee Holdingson 16December 2013was aloan repayable on demand.A declaration that the amount of $1,000,000 advanced to the first defendant byJ & MMcNamee Holdingson 18 March 2015 was a loan repayable on demand.Order the first defendant to pay the first plaintiff $1,250,000.The Further Amended Statement of claim is otherwise dismissed.Cross-claim is dismissed.The first defendantpay the plaintiffs’costsof the Further Amended Statement of Claim and the Cross-Claimas agreed or assessed.Grant liberty to the parties to apply for an alternative costs orderwithin seven days of today's date,setting out the application and any evidenceand submissionsof no more than 3 pages upon which they rely.Should such an application be made for an alternative costs order, the responding party is to provide evidence and submissions of no more than 3 pages opposingany alternative costs order within seven days of receiving thefirstapplication.The Court will determine any such alternative costs application on the papers, if appropriate.**********DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.

The reality of most modern litigation is that there is no opportunity for any determination of capacity or knowledge and approval in advance of the trial. In truth, the role of the presumptions flowing from the due execution of a rational will primarily affectsnotso much the conduct of the trial and the determination by the Court, butthe preparation of litigationin advance of trial,and in particular the decisions to adduce evidence of cognitive capacity and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will."}, {"p_num": 14, "text": "This litigation also indicates a further difficulty with the utility of the notion of“suspicious circumstances”.

As it happens, there is approximate equality in the consideration stated for stamp duty purposes insofar as the net wealth of each of Spiro and Marika increased by about the same amount.(Spiro obtained a property valued at $140,000 but surrendered his 50% interest in a property valued at $125,000, which is to say a net gain of $77,500, while Marika gained a half interest in a property valued at $125,000, which is to say a net gain of $62,500.)

Accordingly, the only orders I shall make are the following:"}], "full_text": "JUDGMENTLEEMING JA: Two proceedingswere heard by me, botharisingfrom the death of Ms RebekaDeligiannison 22 January 2022 aged 85.The parties to each are two of her three children, Ms MarikaDedakisand Mr JimDeligiannis.For convenience and without disrespector unwarranted familiarityI shall refer to the various family members by their given namesin the form usedat the trial, noting thatRebeka is variously spelt, and was also known as Aunt Rena,Jim was also known as Dmitri,andMarika was often known as Maria and is so named in the will, but“Marika”convenientlydistinguishes her fromhercousin Mariaand her sister-in-law Mary,each of whomgave evidencein Jim’s case.The only substantial asset inthedeceased estate is a home inAustralia St,Camperdown which is valuedat some$2.9million.Aside from the costs of this litigation, the liabilities are few, such that the net value of the estate is approximately $2.74 million.Procedural backgroundBysummons in theSuccession & Probate List(Probate)dated 6 May 2022, Jimseeksa grant of probate in common form in respect of a will executed by the deceased on 20 August 2013 appointing him assoleexecutor which leaves the estate 75% to him and 25% to Marika.Marika responded by two general caveats, the first filed on 17 May 2022, and the second on 17 November 2022(upon the lapsing of the first: Supreme Court Rules 1970(NSW), Pt 78 r 69).By summons in the Succession & Probate List(Family Provision)filed on 16 November 2022,Marika opposes the will being admitted to probate, on the bases of capacity, knowledge and approval, and undue influence.She seeks a declaration that her mother died intestate.Marika alsomakesa claim for a family provision order under theSuccession Act2006(NSW).Her application was made within the 12 months specified by s 58(2), andit is accepted thatshe isan“eligible person”.Bycross-claimfiled in the proceeding commenced by Marika,Jimseeks a grant of probate in solemn form, as well asa claim for mesneprofitsfor the periodduring which Marika remained in possession of the home after her mother’s death.Thecross-claimalso seekspossession of the home, but that relief is no longer needed(although the claim is relevant to an issue concerning the availability of mesne profits).Jim obtained a representation order pursuant to r 7.10of theUniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005(NSW)on 27 October 2023for the purposes of the family provision claim and thecross-claim, and an order for administrationpendente liteof the estate for the purposes, inter alia, of preparing the house for sale and selling it. Marikavacated possession on 20 February 2024. The property has not been sold, although it seems inevitable that that will occur on any view of the outcome of the litigation, and Jim’s evidence is thathe intendsto do so.Nothing turns on there being two proceedings. That has beenbrought about because the parties are, sensibly, having two quite different aspects of their dispute resolved at the same time. One is a question of probate:whether thereshould be a grant of probate of the 2013 will.The other is whether a family provision order should be made in favour of Marika. The two are inter-related. When opening the case, Mr Alexis SC, who appeared with Mr Speirs for Marika, confirmed that he only pressed the claim for an order for family provision ifMarika’schallenge to the grant of probate failed(T12.32). When closing the case, Mr Birtles who appeared for Jim confirmed that he did not press his claim for mesne profits ifJimsucceeded inobtaining a grant ofprobate(T214.33).It was open to Jim to havefiledin the probate proceedinga summons for the caveat to cease to be in force,in which case the pleadings which would have ensued would, as a matter of administrative practice, have been filed in the same proceeding: seeRe Estate Capelin, Deceased(2022) 107 NSWLR 461; [2022] NSWSC 236 at [17].Had that course been taken there probably would have been a single proceeding. But that did not occur, and Marika fileda separate summons(as,so far as I can see,she was entitled to do).I mention this only to indicate why there are two proceedings.So far as I can see, nothing substantive turns on itsave that this Court’s orders will have to dispose of two originating processes. Bothproceedings were heardtogether, with evidence in each being evidence in the other.I saw and heard each of Marika, Jim, their brother Spiro, his wife Mary,their cousinMariaand the family solicitor Mr Nicholas Coombesbeingcross-examined on affidavits they had sworn. Mr Coombes had prepared the will as well as witnessing its execution. I also heard evidence in chief and cross-examination of MrFotisKakaroubas, who attended in response to a subpoenaad testificandum. He had come to know the deceased as a friend of his mother, and in 2013 he had prepared a document in Englishat Rebeka’s requestexplaining the rationale forherwill, whichdocument was located with the will in Mr Coombes’office. No other documents from any file were available.The other witnesses were not required for cross-examination.IssuesThe principal legal issues arereadily stated. They are:(a) whether Jim has established that the deceased(i)had capacity in 2013 and(ii)knew and approved the will,(b) whether Marika has established undue influence, and(c) if probate is granted,(i)whether adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in lifeof Marika has not been made by the will and(ii), if not, whether an order should be made and in what amount.The principal factual issueswill not be obvious from the above, but it is convenient to state them now:(a) whether there was a pre-existing will and its effect and whether that was known to Jim,(b) how the 2013 will came to be drafted and executed,(c) whether the justification contained in the will for the less generousprovisionto Marikaiscorrect–this turns on the circumstances by which Spiro came to own property at Belmore and Marika came to own property at Wiley Park, and(d) whether there were reasons for the limited provision made to Marikaother than thosestated in the will.The parties joined issue as to whether there were“suspicious circumstances”.I find that suspicious circumstancesattendedthe making of the 2013 will. That is a result of the collocation of circumstances that(a) an elderly woman made a will so as to leave unequal portions amongst her children,(b) prior to its being made, the son and daughter shared equally in the mother’s deceased estate,(c) the new will was made when the daughter was out of the country,(d) the new will was executed in the presence of the son who became the primary beneficiary,(e) the son who became the primary beneficiary took the testatrix to the solicitors in order for the will to be made, and(f) the solicitor has been unable to produce any file note or any contemporaneous record of instructions made by him.However, I have heard full evidence on all issues, including capacity, knowledge and approval and undue influence.This isnot a case that should be decided by reference to onus, and I find it difficult to see how anything turns onwhether or notthere be suspicious circumstances. Indeed, my experience in this trial confirms my view that where there has been a full hearing, the introduction of a requirement of“suspicious circumstances”which if found cause an evidentiary onus to shift is generally unwarranted.That approach introduces an additional issue, to no useful purpose, and may(as occurred inMekhailv Hana;Mekailv Hana[2019] NSWCA 197) contribute to errorby distracting from an evaluation of the totality of the evidence. I agree with Justice Lindsay’s extra-judicial observation on this point:In the modern form of ‘judge alone(case managed) trial’ it is generally artificial, at least at a final hearing, to analyse a case in terms of a ‘prima faciecase’ or dispositive ‘presumptions’. By the time a judge is called upon to determine a case, it generally must be determined on all the evidence then before the Court, drawing whatever inferences may be available from that evidence: G Lindsay, “The ‘Why?’ and ‘What?’ of ‘Suspicious Circumstances’ in Probate Litigation”, paper delivered to Law Society of South Australia Succession Law Conference, Adelaide, 16 November 2018.That passage was approved inMekhailv Hana;Mekailv Hanaat [168](albeit in obiter), and was followed in(without seeking to be exhaustive)ChalikvChalik[2024] NSWSC 117 at [282](Henry J),Estate ofGuamani;Guamaniv De Cruzado[2023] NSWSC 502 at [225](Meek J);DybacvCzerwaniw[2022] NSWSC 1279 at [235](Slattery J) andRe Estate Capelin,Deceased(2022) 107 NSWLR 461; [2022] NSWSC 236 at [98](Lindsay J).It is also reflected inthe criticisms by Ward CJ in Eq andHallenJ of the artificiality of a two-stage approach involving presumptions inEstate of the late Genevieve Bryan[2022] NSWSC 965 at [425] andStarr v Miller[2021] NSWSC 426at [472]-[474](appeal dismissed [2022] NSWCA 46)respectively.Further, it coheres with the absence of any presumption of undue influence in probate: seeSchwankevAlexakis; Camilleri vAlexakis[2024] NSWCA 118.In short, as Williams J observed inBull v Fulton(1942) 66 CLR 295 at 343;[1942] HCA 13,“[u]suallythe evidence is such that the question upon whom the onus of proof lies is immaterial”.None of the foregoing detracts from the force of the observations inTobin v Ezekiel(2012) 83 NSWLR 757; [2012] NSWCA 285 at [43]-[54]. True it is that a rational willprovento have been duly executed entails a presumption of capacity and of knowledge and approval, absent circumstances which raise a doubt as to either.It will be seen that I have concluded that this is a rational will, and ithas at all timesbeen common ground that it was duly executed.But no court having heard full evidence is entitled to shut its eyes to evidence concerning the testatrix’s capacity or her knowledge and approval of the will and grant probate. The reality of most modern litigation is that there is no opportunity for any determination of capacity or knowledge and approval in advance of the trial. In truth, the role of the presumptions flowing from the due execution of a rational will primarily affectsnotso much the conduct of the trial and the determination by the Court, butthe preparation of litigationin advance of trial,and in particular the decisions to adduce evidence of cognitive capacity and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will.This litigation also indicates a further difficulty with the utility of the notion of“suspicious circumstances”. Despitewhether or notthere are suspicious circumstancesbeinga binary question, ifsuspicious circumstances are found to exist, then it isnecessary to weigh in the balance the strength of the case disfavouring a grant of probate against the case propounded by the executor.Another way of putting this is that“suspicious circumstances”has both a digital and an analogue aspect, failing to appreciate which can lead to error;cf(in a completely different context), R Stevens,“ShouldContributory Fault Be Analogue or Digital?”inA Dysonet al(eds),Defences in Tort(Hart Publishing, 2017) 247.After all, as Viscount Simonds said inWintlev Nye[1959] 1 WLR 284at 291,“[t]he degree of suspicion will vary with the circumstances of thecase. It may be slight and easily dispelled. It may, on the other hand, be so grave that it can hardly be removed.”Uncontroversial factsAll ofthe events occurred more than a decade ago, and many occurred more than three decades ago.Memory is fallible and malleable, especially memory concerningpast beliefs.One ofLordLeggatt’s first judgments contains an extensive and influential consideration of the frailties of memory, including(relevantly for present purposes) thatmemories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with present beliefs:GestminSGPS SA v Credit Suisse(UK) Ltd[2013] EWHC 3560(Comm) at [18].It is usually desirable to start with reliable contemporaneous documents and uncontroversial facts.“Usually, the rational resolution of an issue involving the credibility of witnesses will require reference to, and analysis of, any evidence independent of the parties which is apt to cast light on the probabilities of the situation”:Camden v McKenzie[2008] 1QdR 39; [2007] QCA 136 at [34](Keane JA).Thatis not to deprecate the potential significance of testimonial evidence.In particular, aswas said by Bell P inET-China.com International Holdings Ltd v Cheung[2021] NSWCA 24;388 ALR 128 at [27]-[29], testimonial evidencemay provide valuable assistancein explaining the context of, and omissionsfrom, the contemporaneous documents.That is ofparticular pertinencein the present case, in respect of the property transactions which occurred in 1988 and 1992.Accordingly, Istart with what is either uncontroversial or established by contemporaneous documents.There were three children of the marriage of Rebeka and ConDeligiannis: Spiro(born in 1960), Marika(born in 1966) and Jim(born in 1968). All children lived with their parents at the Australia St property until they were married, and,in the case of Marika, after she was married.Very little emerges from the evidence about Rebeka’s and Con’s early life.According to her death certificate, she was born in AgiosKostantinosSpartiin Greece, and arrived in Australia aged 21.Rebeka only ever spoke brokenEnglish, andseems to have been unable to write in English. She had an English signature, but revealinglya signature she made in 2016, when she was ailing, uses Greek characters(the‘e’s in Rebeka are epsilons and the‘g’in her surname is a gamma). It seems probable that she arrived in Australia from Greece after theSecondWorldWar, like many others, and worked hard to establish herself in a new country.There is evidence that the traditions of the church, especially Easter and Christmas, were very important to Rebeka.SadlyCon passed away in 1982, when the children were aged 21, 15 and 13. At that stage, Rebeka inherited not only the Australia St family home, but also a property on Bridge Rd in Belmore.She did not remarry.An issue to which I shall return is whether Rebeka made a will after her husband’s death.The olderson Spiro has renounced all claims to the estate(both in the event of intestacy and under theSuccession Act). The circumstances in which that occurred are relevant to Marika’s claims.The purchase and sale of LakembaIn 1980Spirobecame a co-owner, with his parents, of property atMcDonald StLakemba. On paper,hewas tenant in common as to half, and his parents as joint tenants of the other half interest. The purchase price was $46,000. Spiro gave evidence that his parents were guarantors; it also seems likely that their presence wasnecessary in order to obtain a bank loan, prior tothe deregulation of the banking systema few years later.Spiro gave evidence in cross-examination, and I did not understandthereto be any challenge to it, that he made all of the repayments of principal and interest byhimself, andbecame entitled to the entirety of the proceeds of salein 1988.That this was uncontroversial wasmadeclear from Spiro’s cross-examination:Q. … I think many years after, you were surprised to see – that the Lakemba unit was purchased not only in your name, but also in the name of your parents?A. In those days, what I was - I was 20 years old, but couldn’t get a bank loan, so I went with my father to the CBC Bank to get the loan, and it was, you know, on the proviso that he’s the - their name’s on the title also. Now, the situationis that I worked nightshift. I worked Friday nights and Saturday nights. I full gave up my - my - my life to get a - to get ahead in life.Q. Understood. This isn’t controversial, I don’t think, but I just want to tick this off with you, if I may. Your mother and father didn’t contribute one cent to the purchase of the home unit at Lakemba?A. That’s correct.Q. They, for all intents and purposes, treated you as the only owner, the sole owner of the property?A. Correct.In 1988, after Con’s death, Rebeka and Spiro sold theLakembaproperty, foraround$59,000.There was uncontroversial evidence that there was talk of giving it to Marika, who found the property unsuitable.The acquisition of WileyPark by Spiro and MarikaIn 1988, Marika paid a holding deposit of $500, and then Spiro paid the balance of the deposit of $11,000, on a flat inDenman AvenueWiley Parkacquired by themat a price of$115,000. Spiro and Marika acquired the property as tenants in common in equal shares, with the balance of the purchase price coming from a loan from the National Australia Bank in the amount of $60,000, and the rest from Spiro.InaroundJune 1988 when Marika obtained a half interest in Wiley Park, she was aged 21(about to turn 22)andliving at home. Marika made no suggestion that she contributed any of the deposit(save for the $500) or any of the funds required at settlement, although it is also common ground that she was solely responsible to service the mortgage.She acceptedthat Spiro’s contribution to the purchase price was $59,131.40(being $11,000 of the deposit and the entirety of the amounts required on settlement(principally, stamp duty of $2,515.50and $1,588.45 charged by Coombes, Lucas & Co)save for the $60,000 borrowed from the bank).The memorandum of costs and disbursementsat settlementincludesan amount of$95described as:TO OUR COSTS of acting on yourbehalvesin relation to Power of Attorney and attending to the stamping and registration thereof sayNo other evidence, so far as I can see,refers to any power of attorney. However,there is no reason to doubt that onecame into existenceat this time.The donormust have beenSpiro or Marika orboth of them.The memorandum of transfer is signed by the vendors, but not signed by either Spiro or Marika but instead is signed by the“solicitor for transferee”, Nicholas Constantine Coombes(although to be clear he does sign explicitly as thedoneeof a power of attorney).Nonetheless, it seemslikely thatneither Spironor Marikaattended settlement. This curiosity was not explored in the evidence, despite the contrast withwhat occurred in 1992.The propertyat Wiley Parkwas tenanted thereafter, initiallyat a rent of $140 per week, which was almost sufficient to meet the repayments required by the bank(which were $656 per month for a20 yearmortgage of $60,000 at 14.5% per annum).Spiro gave evidence that he made no repayments, and that it was agreed between the siblings that Marika would be solely responsible for the repayments and outgoings, and solely entitled to the rent.Marika accepted that it was a relatively spacious unit, renovated by Jim ten years ago, with two bedrooms and an internal laundry.Marika acquires full ownership of Wiley Park and Spiro is givenBelmoreIn 1990, Spiro married his first wife, and left the Australia St home. His wife died in 1992, following which Spiro returned to the family home, living there until 1999.Two memoranda of transfer were signed on 20 March 1992.In one,Rebeka transferred theBelmoreproperty to Spiro.In the other, Spiro transferred his half interest in the Wiley Park property to his sister.Both memoranda of transfer identified a consideration.There is no suggestion in the evidence that any money was paid by anyone in these intra-family transfers, but the fact that a transaction was notfor valuable considerationdidnot mean thatad valoremduty was not payable, and accordingly it was necessary to determine a price.In the case of Rebeka’s transfer of Belmore to Spiro, the stated consideration was $140,000, and the document has a handwritten annotation of $3,388 which ishighlysuggestive of stamp duty(it is almost exactly“$1,290 plus $3.50 for every $100 orpart thereofby which the amount exceeds $80,000”which was the rate prescribed for conveyances of property where the amount of consideration exceeded $80,000 but did not exceed $300,000 in Part 1 of the Second Schedule to theStamp Duties Act 1920(NSW)).In the case of Spiro’s transfer of a half interest in Wiley Park to Marika, the stated consideration was $62,500. The transfer is stamped, but the amount of duty paid is illegible on the copy tendered.The signatures of each of Rebeka and Spiro on the Belmore transfer, and each of Spiro and Marika on the Wiley Park transfer, were witnessed by Mr Coombes.The transfer of Spiro’s half interest was not lodgeduntilsome months later, at the same time as Marika,now as sole owner,mortgaged the land to secure her obligation to the bank. At that stage, the mortgage appears to have been stamped for loan security dutyon the basis ofindebtedness of $64,000.(The stamp is unclear, but the handwritten numbers 64,000 and 197 areperfectly legible, and loan security duty was payable at the time at the rate of“$5 for the first $16,000 and 0.4% on the amount exceeding the first $16,000”, and 197 = 5 + 0.004 x 48,000.) That is suggestive, although not determinative, of Marika’s indebtedness to the bank in 1992, almost four years into the term of the facility, having increased to $64,000.To reiterate, it was common ground that Spiro received Belmore–where he lives to this day–as an“early inheritance”, and that in fact he paid nothing for it.(He received it in 1992, but he gave evidence that the property requiredcompletedemolition and rebuilding.)It was common ground that Marika paid nothing for the half interest in Wiley Park whichwas transferred by Spiro to her.It is true that Rebeka did not convey any real propertydirectlytoMarikaduring her lifetime. Marikacontended that Spiro’s decision to give her hisone halfinterest in Wiley Park was hisowndecision, not her mother’s.Marika continues to own the Wiley Park property. It continues to be tenanted.It also continues to be mortgaged. At some stage Marika refinanced with Westpac. It may be that this occurred in July 2003. Exhibit D is an incomplete collection of Westpac bank statements concerning both a“variable rate investment property loan”and a“fixed rate investment property loan”obtained by Marika. The earlier Westpac statements show debt to that bank not exceeding $28,000, while on 15 July 2003 the same account has withdrawals of $101,369.24 and $17,859.88, at least one of which is consistent with paying out indebtednessexceeding $100,000to the National Australia Bank. There arealsodebitsof $17,000 on 1 April 2015and$20,000 on 21 April 2015(Marikasaid she withdrew large amounts to buy a car and to pay for repairs to the roof of the house). The overalleffect ofthe withdrawalscombined withlimitedrepayments(at this time, approximately $50 each week), wasthat thedebtincreasedfrom $162,904 in January 2015 to $229,987 by July 2015.Marika disclosed in her first affidavit in November 2022 a mortgage debt of $270,000.After being cross-examined on the most recent bank statements, she gave this evidence:Q. MsDedakis, the statements that I’ve taken you to show that your loan account balance has increased from about $50,000 to about $294,000 over the last 20 years. Do--A. Yes.Q. --you agree? The reason for that increase is twofold:(a), capital purchases - things like cars; and(b), you’ve drawn down on your loan to repay your credit cards. Do you agree?A. I agree.During his cross-examination, Spiro expressed surprise that Marika had not repaid the relatively small mortgage on Wiley Park, more than 30 years later.Events between 1993 and 2013As noted above, Spiro returned to Australia St in 1992, where he lived until his second marriage in 1999. Jim lived in Australia St until he married in 1996. Marika lived in Australia St with her mother for the entirety of her life, until February this year. However, in 2013 she married, and thereafter her husband also lived at Australia St.The 2013 will and handwritten documentThe will is a straightforward document of fourshortclauses. It was plainly typed in Mr Coombes’office. Clause 1 revokes earlier wills. Clause 2 appoints Jim as executor and trustee. Clause 3 gives the entirety of Rebeka’s estate 75% to Jim and 25% to Marika. Clause 4 provides:I CONFIRM that I have intentionally and specifically not provided in this my Will for my son SPIRO DELIGIANNIS or a greater share for my daughter MARIA DELIGIANNIS as I have assisted them both financially during my life andin particular butnot limited to SPIRO DELIGIANNIS in respect of a residential property in Belmore and MARIA DELIGIANNIS in respect of a residential unit in Wiley Park.The will was signed by Rebeka, using English characters. Her signature was witnessed by Mr Coombes and another solicitor in the office.Mr Coombes did not retain a filefor the steps taken in 2013. However, he produced the followingdocumentwhich was kept with the will in his safe, which became Exhibit F:It was uncontroversial that most of the handwriting was that of MrFotisKakaroubas, a friend of Rebeka(or more precisely, the son ofherfriend)who lived nearbyandwho got to know the deceased while he and his mother werewalking inCamperdown. The signature at the bottom left(which is in a different pen)appears to be that of Rebeka, and closely resembles thaton the will. The writing at the top right is that ofMr Coombes, andsays“Prepared by a neighbour!”It may be noticed that while the will speaks of Marika receivingtheunit inWiley Park, the note refers to her receiving the unit at Lakemba. Wiley Park and Lakemba are neighbouring Sydney suburbs.Events between 2013 – 2022There was no challenge to Marika’s evidence that she first learnt of the 2013 will in around 2016. She said that after her mother’s cognitive functionhad declined, she attended Mr Coombes’office withJim and perhaps Spiro for the purpose of Rebeka executing an enduring power of attorney and appointing an enduring guardian. Those documents were executed and are dated 22 July 2016.Marikasaid she was shocked when, while waiting for Mr Coombes in his offices,there was a conversation to the following effect between her and Jim after she suggested that they look attheir mother’swill, with a view to its being updated to include Stacie(Jim’s second child) and Constantine(Spiro’s child). She said that the following exchange then occurred:Jim: Don’t worry, it’s been fixed.Marika: What do you mean, it’s been fixed?Jim: 70-30.Marika: What do you mean 70 – 30?Jim: 70 per cent to me and 30 per cent to you. Why should the kids get my inheritance? And the money is not going to end up in Canberra.Jim agreed thatmost oftheaboveexchange took place, and the two of them were whispering, waiting to be called into Mr Coombes’office.Marika and Jim agreed that Rebeka did not react to the conversation. Marika suggestedbutJim denied that that reflected Rebeka’s dementia at that stage; Jim said thatthe two of them were whispering and their mother had not heard them. Butit is clear that onthat day, Rebeka was unable to sign one of the documents, save with a cross, and she had been diagnosed with dementia more than a year earlier, in June 2015. I note that no medical records whatsoever were tendered in this trial, and June 2015 is a reference toJim’s substantiallyunchallenged testimonial evidence.Marika said she was shocked and speechless and had a feeling of helplessness. She said that she would“never forget”the abrupt response she received from Mr Coombes when she told him she was in a state of shock because she had just learned of the will, and he said“Well, that was your mother’s wishes”.On 1 December 2016 Marika forwarded an authority, purportedly signed by her mother, to Mr Coombes which stated:Dear Nick,I authorize your office to provide to mydaughter MarikaDedakis(MariaDeligiannis) a copy of my will.Yours faithfully[signature]RebekaDeligiannisThe signature resembled that of Rebeka.In cross-examination,Marikavolunteered that she had forged her mother’s signature. Neither theenduringpower of attorney nor theappointment as enduring guardian authorisedher to do so.However, Marika’s counsel observed that while it had been wrong for Marika to deceive Mr Coombes, her claim that she had been under a deal of pressure at the time was not challenged in cross-examination, and far from seeking to conceal what she had done, she volunteered the fact that she had signed the letter as soon as the issue was raised. I agree with Mr Alexis that very little turns on Marika’s credit in this litigation.Mr Coombes provided the copy of the willto Marika.Thereafter, Marika spentsomefive years knowing that her mother was not competent to write another will.Rebeka stayed at home until May 2017, where she was cared for principally by Marika. Commencing in May 2017(a date established by financial records), Rebeka began to spendmany days each monthat a day care nursing home run by Uniting Care Service, which also included occasional overnight stays. For example, in October 2017, Rebeka attended at the centre for 25 days and two nights. At some stage thereafter, she moved to full-time residence at an aged care facility in Marrickville. Marika said she visited her mother every day prior to Covid restrictions. Rebeka passed away on 22 January 2022, aged 85.In April 2022 Marika’s solicitors wrote to Mr Coombes querying thewill, andstating that Marika had serious reservationsabout itincluding her beliefs that Rebeka lacked capacity and that the will did not contain her testamentary intentions.Mr Coombes confirmed that he did not retain a file, and that he did not have a 1998 will. After the first caveat was lodged, Mr Coombes wrotea longerletterin responsewhich included:The executor is greatly offended by the allegations in your letter. There was no lack of capacity and there was no undue influence. We are in possession of a considerable body of evidence that clearly demonstrates that there is no merit in the allegations made in your letter.Mr Coombes thereafter declined the solicitor’s request to be provided with the considerable body of evidence.It is not entirely clear to what he had been referring.Shortly thereafter he ceased to act, and Jim’s current solicitors were retained. They wrote a long letter dated 26 August 2022, which included an open offer, and which attached emails from Maria(Jim’s and Marika’s cousin) and Mary(Jim’s and Marika’s sister-in-law), both dated 1 August 2022.Maria’s email included the following:I am writing this email so you can have some information tomorrow and are happy to provide a formal statement to the three of youat a later date.My statement will include my conversations to the best of my recollection -outlined below:On three separate occasions during my visits with Aunty Rena(RebekaDeligiannis) with my mother(KostoulaDeligiannis) Aunty Rena expressed concerns about her homexxxAustralia street Camperdown.Time frame Before Maria's Wedding to KostaDedakisVisit one and twoAunty Rena stated she was worried about Kosta and Maria making a claim on her home(thexxxAustralia street Camperdown property) since Maria and Kosta[Dedakis]willbe living there after Maria and Kosta's marriage. Aunty Rena specifically stated she did not want Kosta or his family making any claim on her home. Aunty Rena also asked if KostaDedakiscould make a claim on her home should Maria and Kosta divorce if they were living her home after their marriage. Aunty Rena stated that her home which she bought with her late husband(KostaDeligiannis) was to be left to her son Jim(Deligiannis), since the other two children(Spiro, Maria) had already been given their inheritance over the years and that Jim was the only child that had not received any inheritance.I reassured aunty Rena as best as I could. I unpacked her concerns so I could understand them and broke them down so I could confirm what she was saying. I recommended having this type of conversation(raising her concerns and wishes) first with Maria as she is a reasonable person and would want to protect her(aunty Rena) and the family home. Then with all three children present without their partners so all three children are aware of her concerns and wishes. I said to her that I did not know what her legal situation was and that I was not across the legal stuff regarding her concerns so maybe it would be a good idea to get some independent legaladvise.1. About Aunty Rena's concerns that Kosta(Dedakis) and his family making a claim onxxxAustralia Street Camperdown - I suggested speaking to all three children first and then obtain legaladviseegmaybe get some legal document signed by the relevant parties to protect Aunty Rena's house before Kosta and Maria get married and move in. I asked if she had a lawyer which she stated shedidand hespoke Greek. I encouraged her to have a meeting with him to express her concerns and what she could do to safeguard her home as per her wishes.2.About Aunty Rena's will– I asked if Aunty Rena if she had a will. Aunty Rena informed me she did have a will. I said to her I did not know thedetailsbut it was my understanding over the years was that Spiro had received Belmore house as his inheritance and Maria had received a flat in Wiley park or Lakemba as her inheritance and Jim was to inherit Australia street upon her death. I asked her if that was correct? Aunty Rena replied that was correct. I reassured her then that everything should beokbut she should check with her lawyer to ensure that her concerns and wishes were also reflected in her will. Aunty Rena informed me that she would do that. Aunty Rena specifically and strongly stated that the family home and I quote“theirfathershome is to stay with Jim(Deligiannis) and not go to theCanberrians”Time frame After Maria’s weddingVisit oneAunty Rena was very concerned expressing her concerns outlined in points one and two above. I asked her if she had she spoken to Maria specifically or to her other children before Maria got married or had she got legaladvise. Aunty Rena stated she found it difficult to approach Maria as she feared that they would argue. She stated that she would get legaladvise.Visit twoAunty Rena told me not to worry as she has taken care of her concerns rexxxAustralia StreetCamperdown.Mary’s email included the following:I cannot recall the exact date(s) of the conversation(s) between my mother-in-law and my-selfbut they were at a time frame prior to her daughter, MariaDeligiannis’, wedding.I spoke on the phone and visited my mother-in-law on a regularbasisand it was during one of those one-on-one visits where she confided in me that she wanted to find someone to take her to her solicitor in Marrickville to amend[her]last Will.I did not want[to]become involved in such a private family matter between her and her children and so I did not take her. She mentioned it to me again on another occasion but again I did not want to become involved and so did not offer to take her.After a certain amount of time(I cannot recall date) my mother-in-law confided in me that she found someone to take her to her solicitor and that she changed her Will. She did not tell me who took her nor what the change involved and nor did I ask.I prefer not to be involved in the current situation of my mother-in-law’s last Will. I wish to remain a neutral party between Jim and Maria as I value them both.Theessence of theoffermade by Jim’s solicitorwas vacation of the home by 30 September 2022, a waiver of any entitlement to an occupation fee for thesevenmonths Marika had lived at Australia St after Rebeka’s death, and an increase in Marika’s entitlement under the will to one third.ThereafterMarika caused a series of questions to be askedofher older brother Spiro in an email exchange, part of which was in evidence. The questions referred to a 1988 will, which in her evidence Marika said was an error for 1998. The questions followed by Spiro’s answers in bold included the following:(i) is he aware that your mother made a Will in 1988, and if so:In 1988 I was overseas for approx. 4months,I do recall that a will was done as mentioned by Maria.(a) who was the solicitor who drafted the 1988 Will.Nicholas Coombes is/was thesolicitor(b) did he take your mother to the solicitor to make the 1988 Will;I can’t recall. I think AnastasiosSpyrouliastookher(c) did the 1988 Will leave your mother’s estate 50% to you and 50% to your brother Jim.I didn’t or haven’t seen the will, at the time ourmother stated that it was equal shares[between]Maria and JimThe offerin Jim’s solicitor’s letterwas not accepted, and proceedings were commenced by Marika in November.Rather than summarising the testimonial evidence, which was relatively brief,(with the cross-examination lasting one and a half days)and all of which was affected by the passage of time, it is more efficient to proceed directly to the factual issues.Was there a previous will?I find that there was a previous will.Rebekamade it inaround 1998. No such will was in evidence. However, theinherent probabilities coupled with theweight of evidence supports its existence.First, it will be recalled that after her husband’s death in 1982,Rebekawas a widow who owned the family homeanda property atBelmore, andco-ownedaproperty at Lakemba with Spiro.Theevidence all points one way in favour of the gift of land at Belmoreto Spiro in 1998beingin lieu of an inheritance. A pre-inheritance gift to a child, in lieu of an inheritance, is only effective if there is a will which departs from the equal sharing of children on intestacy.Moreover, Spiro’s first wife died in 1992, and he had returned to the family home with his widowed mother. He married his second wife in 1999.Jim married in 1996and their son Constantine was born soon after.Thosesignificant changes in the family structurewould have made the making of a will by the mother in 1998 or 1999areasonably obvious and appropriate step to take.Thirdly, there is testimonial evidence of an earlier will:Marika gave evidence, about which she was not cross-examined, that she had spoken with her mother about the previouswill, andhad at one stage been given it and read its contents. Sherememberedthat it left $30,000 toJim’s son, and $30,000 to Spiro to give to his futurechild, anddivided the balance equally between herself and Jim.Spiro likewise acceptedin cross-examination, consistently with his response to Marika’s email reproduced above,that his mother told him there was an earlier will, and that he believed that Marika’s godfather took her to Mr Coombes for it to be drawn up. He agreedwhen responding to Marika’s emailthat“there was a monetary amount for the grandchildren, born and future”. The references by Marika and Spiro to future grandchildren dovetail with Spiro’s second marriage in 1992 and the prospect of children.Maria gave evidence, consistent with her email of 1 August 2022,that she had had a conversation with Rebeka before the wedding in which she had asked if“Aunty Rena”had a will and had been told that she did.Mary’s evidence was to the effectthat Rebeka had asked her to take her to a solicitor in Marrickville toamendher will, andsheagreed in cross-examination that she knew that the earlier willleftsome money(she was unsure how much) to her son, and was aware that the position had changed. The cross-examination on this issue concluded as follows:Q. But two things are clear. Before August 2013, you had an understanding that your son was to benefit under--A. Yes.Q. --his grandmother’swill?A. Yes, correct.Q. After 2013, you learnt that that hadchanged?A. Yes.Marika submitted that insofar as the evidence suggested that the earlier willcontaineda legacy to Jim’s son, that enabled the will to be dated to around 1998.It is true that Mr Coombes was unaware of a previous will, but that carries little weight when it would not beexpected thathe would have any actual recollection, and his office’s records were demonstrably fallible even for a will made in 2013.I am comfortably satisfied that there was a will, principally because it seems inherently probablethatafamily that placed great store on propertyensured that their affairs were properly regulated, andbecausethe weight of evidence favours that being the case.What was the nature of the earlier will and was Jim aware of it?There was some evidence that the earlier willleftAustralia St to Jim.In particular, thatwas Maria’s evidence in her 1 August 2022 email reproduced above. She confirmed it in an affidavit which was to substantially the same effect as that email.Jim gave evidence to the same effect in cross-examination.It will also be noted that Marika’s email to Spiro proceeded on the basis that the earlier will divided Rebeka’s estate equally between Spiro and Jim; this may have been another error.Butthedifficulty withany scenario whereby Marika received nothing under her mother’searlierwill is that in that event there was scarcely any plausiblebasis for a fear that“the Canberrans”would take such property as Marika might inherit if Rebeka predeceasedher(as was probable)and Marika’s marriage foundered.Further, to the extent that there was still such a basis, amending the will would not address the fear.Marika was married on 22 June 2013. She took her husband’s name. I shall refer to him as“Costa”, without disrespect or familiarity, because it was the name universally used in the evidence.There was a deal of evidence that Rebeka was agitated by her daughter’s marriage and the threat she perceived it entailed.No doubt she wished the best for her daughter, but that is not inconsistent with a concern that there was a possibility that her marriage might fail, in which caseMarika’sformer husband might make a claim against such property as Marika had inherited.Thus Jim gave evidence of his awareness of his mother’s agitation at the time of the wedding concerning the risk that Costa might make a claim, perhaps especially if the house ended up being owned or partly owned by Marika:Q. And you knew that Costa might be able to make a claim in the sense that your mother's property or money might end up in Canberra?A. That was my mother’s biggest concern. My mother's biggest concern, yes.Q. What I’m asking you is whether you understood that?A. I guess, yeah, I would’ve understood it, I guess. But, yeah, it wasn’t my biggest concern, it was my mother’s.Q. If we just go to the conversation which you told the Court now you can’t remember saying to your sister, “And the money is not going to end up in Canberra”, that’s a short hand way of expressing something that you well understood at the time, namely Costa could make a claim and any inheritance that Marika received from her mother could go via such a claim to Canberra; correct?A. That sounds correct, I guess.Q. That’s exactly what any reference to money ending up in Canberra--A. Yeah, but like I said to you before, it was my mother’s words. They weren’t my words. That was my mother’s biggest fear.Q. But you shared that fear as well; didn’t you?A. Well, it's my mother’s fear, yeah. Any family would.Q. May his Honour take it that you and your mother discussed that subject at leastoncebut may I suggest many times before your sister got married?A. It was, but I can’t say many times. Mum did bring that up with me.There was also a deal of evidence, which to the extentit was presented in cross-examination I found highly persuasive,that afterRebekahad made the 2013 will, sheconveyed to her family that shefelt a sense of relief. For example, Maria gave this evidence at the conclusion of her cross-examination:Q. Just one other thing I want to take up with you before I sit down. On the second visit after the wedding, your Aunt Rena seems to have got herself to a completely different frame of mind; is that right?A. Yes. There was a vast change in her.Q. A vast change?A. Yep.Q. And whatever had occurred, which I gather you didn’t know what hadactually occurred?A. No, I didn’t.Q. But whatever it was, what you saw was relief; is that right?A. Yes.Q. Relief in relation to the concerns that she had expressed earlier.A. Yes.Q. And to the extent that she spoke about it she told you that she’d taken care of her concerns about the house; is that right?A. She said inGreek..(foreign language).. like don’t worry, I’ve, I’ve taken care of everything.Q. Yes.A. Yeah.Q. And you took that as being taken care of everything in relation to the house?A. Yes.Similarly, Spiro’s wife Mary recalled learning that Marika had made a new will:Q. Then I think you’ve subsequently found out that someone had taken your mother-in-law to change her will; is that right?A. Correct. She said to me, “I’ve found someone who took me”, and that was that. I didn’t ask who, when, what, why. Nothing, what changed, but she was quite elated, like, she was, like, you know, weight off your shoulders happy. You know. That’s - she had found someone to take her.Both of those witnesses gave evidence in a fashion which was unaffected and which I found credible.In short, I do not accept that the 1998 will leftnothing to Marika. There is overwhelming evidence that Rebeka was very concerned about the threat posed by Marika’s marriage and a claim upon any inheritanceMarikamight receive, and that leads me to conclude that the earlier willleft moreof Rebeka’s estate to Marika than did the 2013 will.The relief that Rebeka conveyed after she executed the 2013 will confirms this.I furtherfind that Jim was aware of this. His conceded awareness of his mother’s fear goes far towards the conclusion that Jim was aware that under an existing will, Marika would receive a significant part of Rebeka’s deceased estate.As was put to him in cross-examination, if he believed that Marika was not a beneficiary under the earlier will, there was no basis(or at least a much lesswell-foundedbasis) for his mother’s fear.The circumstances in which thewillwasexecutedThe 2013 will wasevidently prepared and printedin Mr Coombes’office. There is no reason to doubt his recollection that there were two conferences with the client: the first to elicit her instructions, and the second to execute the typed document.That accorded with his usualpractice, andis the obvious inference to draw from the fact that the will had been prepared on a computer but left undated when Rebeka came to execute it.It is possible that there were more than two meetings, but the will was straightforward so that seems unlikely.There is no reason to doubt that before execution, the will was read out aloud, in Greek, and that Rebeka executed it, in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed their names, one of whom was Mr Coombes.Mr Coombes has retained the original will andthehandwritten document signed by the deceased. He has not retained a file. It is unclear precisely what efforts were made by anyone to obtain a diary, an appointments schedule, or records of timing or billing from 2013, and it is indeed possible that he provided the service of drafting a straightforward will to a long-standing client for free.The handwritten document is the only contemporaneous record of the deceased’s instructionswhich precedes the will.Unfortunately it is undated. What is also not known is when the first meeting with Mr Coombes took place, and on what days MrKakaroubascalled upon Rebeka: first when heprepared his document, andsecond whenhe was told by Jim words to the effect that his assistance was no longer needed.As ithappens, quite a lot turns on the precise sequence of events in June, July and August 2013.The sequence of events in 2013I find that there were two meetings with Mr Coombes, the second of which took place on 20 August 2013 when the will was executed.I accept the entirety of MrKakaroubas’evidence. He was assisting a friend of his mother, in a very personal matter, which involved a division of her estate after her death unequally between her children, the wedding of one of whom he had recently attended as a guest.The occasion was unusual and intrinsically memorable, and there is no reason for his memory to have been distorted by time.I accept his evidence(as did his cross-examiner) that Rebeka had told him, either then or at some later time,“I don’t want Costa and his children to take this house or my money”. I accept that the production of the handwritten note occurred in accordance with his evidence–which involved him attending at the Australia St property twice havingtaken instructions from Rebeka on the firstoccasion, andreturning with his handwritten note later(my impression from his evidence was that this occurred on the same day although that was not explicitly said). I also accept that at some later stage he returned to Australia St where heencountered not only Rebeka, whomhe had been expecting, but also Jim. I accept that MrKakaroubaswas surprised because he thought he had been helping Rebeka in a matter in which her children were not involved. I also accept that he has nopreciserecollection of whether Jimsaid“Thank you for your help, there’s no need for further assistance”or“I’ll take care of things”(he acceded in cross-examination to questions to the effect that Jim told him allthose things, but I attribute that to his manner of answering questions, rather than accepting that all of those words were said).MrKakaroubaswas clear that whatever the words used, Jim made it clear that his role was complete.Evidently MrKakaroubas’first visits occurred before 20 August 2013. I find that those visits occurredafterRebeka’s first appointment with Mr Coombes.I start with the objective evidence, which is not informed by any assessment of any witness.The handwritten note is in English. Rebeka took some effort to have it made in English. If shehadwanted, when she first visited Mr Coombes, a written explanation for her instructions, it would have been easy for her to provide it to him in Greek, and that would not have required the involvement of a third person.That is to say, Ican see no good reason why Rebeka, in advance of her first meeting with Mr Coombes, would consider it necessary to prepare a document in English.The handwritten note commences with the words“IRevikaDeligiannisam writing this letter to express my intentions regarding my estate upon my death”. That isthe sort of language that a solicitor might use when asking a client toprovide in handwriting the reasons for a will which treated her children unequally.Conversely, it isan unlikely introductiontoa letter which was drafted unprompted by hersolicitor.There is a discrepancy between the handwritten document and the will. While both provide an explanation for the diminished gift to Marika by reason of her inter vivas receipt of property, the handwritten note refers to Lakemba while the will refers to Wiley Park. If the handwritten note were provided at the first meeting, then the reference to Lakemba must have been corrected at that meetingin order forthe will to refer to Wiley Park. If thatis whathappened, it would be natural for the handwritten note to be amended and initialledby Marika so that it coincided with the will.While I think this is a consideration of less weight than the twomentioned above, the fact that the handwritten note was unamended but nonethelessretainedwith the willalso tends to suggest that it was provided at the second meeting.Tothe foregoingmay be added thefact that Mr Coombes gave evidence, which must be regarded only as based upon his usual practice, that the handwritten note would have reflected an instructiongivento clients to provide an explanation in their handwriting for any unequal division of their estates. That evidence is inherently plausible.Finally, there is the annotation made by Mr Coombes,“Prepared by a neighbour!”. He was asked whether it reflected surprise, which he denied. The reasons for his annotation will never be knownwith certainty. He evidently and unsurprisingly had no recollection of it. But it is consistent with his receiving a document at the second conference, which complied with arequestfrom him to provide a handwritten explanation for the unequal distribution of Rebeka’s estate, but which was, unexpectedly, not in the testatrix’s handwriting nor in her language, but in English written by a neighbour, thereby to an extent defeating the purpose of hisrequest.Mr Coombesmay have thought it was so obvious that it went without sayingthat when he toldhis client(speaking in Greek) to return with a handwritten note explaining the reasons for her instructionsthat he intended for her to return with a document written in Greek.However,Rebekamay have appreciated that the will would be in English and wrongly understood the request to be to write out that reasoning in English, which she could not–perhaps to her embarrassment–do. A deal of this paragraph is speculative, and to be clearI regard it as of less weight than the matters mentioned in the precedingtwoparagraphs. Such weight as it hascomesfrom the fact thatI cannot readily bring to mind any other explanation for theannotation.Telling against the foregoing is evidence from Jim that hefirstsaw the note when his mother took it from her handbag when he took her to Mr Coombes. In his first substantive affidavitafter his claim to a grant was challenged by Marika, he said:During the first conference with Mr Coombes, I saw Mum take a document out of her handbag and hand it to Mr Coombes. I had not seen the document before she pulled it out of herhandbagbut I have since seen a copy of it. When Mum took the document out of her handbag, I asked her what itwasand she said words to the effect “I toldFottiwhat I wanted in my Will. I told him what to write down for me and then I signed it.”An important challenge to Jim’s credibility was made based on this evidence.It is important first to identify what is not contentious. For the reasons given above, I am comfortably satisfied that the handwritten note was preparedafterthe first conference with Mr Coombes and provided to him at the second conference, which was when Jim saw it, and thus Jim was wrong in his affidavit to maintain that he saw it at the first conference.The fact that he recalled this was the first conference is an error, but it is an understandableerrorwhich is neither here nor there.The important question of credit relates to whether the second conference with Mr Coombes preceded or followed the second meeting with MrKakaroubas.If MrKakaroubas’second visitprecededthe execution of the will, then Jim’s evidence concerning his first seeing the handwritten note when his mother pulled it from her handbag was incorrect.This is very different from a mistake as to whether he saw it at the first or second conference with Mr Coombes. It is one thing to appreciate after the event that MrKakaroubashad assisted with his mother’s will; it is another thing entirely to know that before the will was executed, andin all likelihoodto know what his mother’s instructions were.IfMrKakaroubas’second visit wasafterthe execution of the will, then the evident sense of the conversations recalled by him would naturally cohere with what had occurred: the occasion for the note had passed, and he was thanked for his help which was no longer needed.It is impossible to say what distance in time separated the two appointments with Mr Coombes, or the two visits by MrKakaroubas. There was no evidence which directly bore upon the former. As for the latter, MrKakaroubassaid“I couldn’t give you a timeframe”, and in answer to the question“within a couple of days, a week or so, thereabouts?”he said“it could have been a month or two. I–I just couldn’t tell you”.I conclude that it is likely that MrKakaroubas’second visit followed the execution of the will.I draw that conclusion from two things. The first is that Rebeka was agitated about the need to make a will. When she first called upon Mr Coombes is not known, but the will she gave instructions to draft was a simple one, which could be prepared in a matter of minutes, and there is nothing to suggest that there would have been any lengthy delay between that occasion and 20 August 2013. To the contrary, the probabilities are that Rebeka would have wanted to execute the will promptly, and would have pushed back if, say, Mr Coombes had proposed a second appointment a month after the first.The second is that MrKakaroubasresisted the suggestion that thesetwo visits were only a matter of days or a week or so apart. While he was at pains to make clear that his recollection was imperfect, he suggested that his visits could have been separated by a month or two.Those two circumstances make it unlikely that MrKakaroubas’second visit preceded the execution of the will. It is not necessary for me to make a finding on the point. It is sufficient for me to conclude that I am not satisfied that MrKakaroubas’second visit preceded the execution of the will.Accordingly the attack on Jim’s credit, insofar as it is based on his being aware of the handwritten note before his mother took it from her handbag at Mr Coombes’office,is not well-founded.I conclude that the most likely sequence of events is(a) Rebeka meets with Mr Coombes and instructs him as to her will,(b) Rebeka meets with and obtains a handwritten note from MrKakaroubas,(c) Rebeka meets with Mr Coombes again and executes her will, and(d) Rebeka and Jim meet with MrKakaroubas.I return to the balance of Jim’s evidence. He is aplumber, who speaks fluent, colloquial English. His answers were direct, in large measure acceding to propositions put to him. My impression was that he was often not conscious ofsome of thenuancein the questions he was asked. It is possible that he was a gifted liar, but I think he was trying to answer questions. That is not merely my general impression, but it is informed by the fact that he made concessionsagainst interest, for example that his mother was concerned about“the Canberrans”and that he was aware ofherconcern and responded to it.There were times when Jim refused to make concessions called for by the cross-examiner, but I consider that at those occasions witness and counsel were at cross-purposes rather than Jim wilfully declining to answer to the best of his recollection.Insofar as an attack was made on Jim’s credit, I reject it. That is not to say that I accept his testimonial evidence without qualification; the opposite is true, for it is susceptible to the same deficiencies caused by the passage of many years, the litigation process and perceived self-interest as most other witnesses. Ultimately most of the critical facts in this litigation derive from documents and other witnesses. Indeed, as the case concluded, I doubt that anything turns on my assessment of Jim’s credibility.The accuracy of clause 4 of the2013 willMarika sought to makesomethingofthetextualdiscrepancy between Wiley Park and Lakembain the handwritten note and the will. More substantively,she also sought to make something ofwhat was said to be the basic erroron the face of the will, namely,that Marika did not receiveWiley Parkfrom her mother. I do not accept these submissions.There was some evidence that Rebeka more naturally referred to the location as Lakembaratherthan Wiley Park. Jim at one stage said that“if you said Lakemba to my mother or Wiley Park to my mother, it was the same thing to her”and although that evidence was volunteered, it is not implausible. Wiley Park is a suburb and has a train station, between Belmore and Punchbowl, but it has little by way of shops compared to the neighbouring suburbs.I have lived in Sydney for most of my life and I am certain that Lakemba is better known than Wiley Park.Counsel’s submissionin this respect was appropriately muted:We candidly accept that Rebeka may have been mistaken or confused about whether Wiley Park was Lakemba, or Lakemba was Wiley Park. However, it shouldn’t be forgotten that in the mix of property transactions, there wasactually atransaction with respect to a separate property in a separate suburb at Lakemba.And so, there is in our submission a question aroundwhether or notthe reference to “Maria has received the unit at Lakemba” is a reference to the Wiley Park unit, or this is the mother saying, she - Maria - received the unit at Lakemba. That is to say, the unit at Lakemba that Spiro used to own.I agree with the approach taken by counsel. The discrepancy between Wiley Park and Lakemba is a distraction. The substantive point is whether Marika received property inRebeka’slifetime.Marika did receive ownership of Wiley Park. She did so on the basis that she contributed a small fraction of the deposit($500). The balance of the purchase price came from Spiro and money borrowed by her and Spiro from the bank. Four years later, Spiro gave her his half of the property, and she appears to have assumed sole responsibility for the mortgage. The upshot is that she obtained ownership of a unit after contributing $500 of capital and assuming the obligation to repay mortgage debt. It is accepted that she obtained the sole benefit of rent received on the property.On any view of the matter, Wiley Park wasin substancea gift to Marika. Who made the gift? I think it is tolerably clear that it was treated as a gift fromRebeka. On 20 March 1992, Rebeka gave Belmore to Spiro, which was valued for stamp duty at $140,000, and on the same day he relinquished his half interest in Wiley Park to Marika, valued for stamp duty at $62,500.The critical jural acts were the signatures of Rebeka and Spiro on each memorandum of transfer. By their signatures, Spiro obtained an interest in the entirety of Belmore, and released his half interest in Wiley Park to his sister.The result was that Spiro became the sole owner of Belmore valued at $140,000, andMarikabecame the sole owner of Wiley Park valued at $125,000.On any view of the matter, the transactions dated 20 March 1992 must be viewed together.They occurred on the same day, and most probably at the same place–in Mr Coombes’office, for he was the witness.Spiro was given Belmore, but on the basis that he would relinquishhis half share of Wiley Park.Although Marika’s ownership in WileyPark was acquired by her purchase as a co-owner in 1988 followed by the transfer from Spiro in 1992, the substance of the matter is that the gift by Spiro to her was intrinsically linked to the gift of Belmore byRebekato Spiro. As it happens, there is approximate equality in the consideration stated for stamp duty purposes insofar as the net wealth of each of Spiro and Marika increased by about the same amount.(Spiro obtained a property valued at $140,000 but surrendered his 50% interest in a property valued at $125,000, which is to say a net gain of $77,500, while Marika gained a half interest in a property valued at $125,000, which is to say a net gain of $62,500.) The evidence is silent as to who paid the stamp duty and other transaction costs.Another way of putting this is that by the two transactions effected on 20 March1992, Rebeka ceased to have beneficial ownership of land worth $140,000,while Spiro’s net worth increased by $77,500 and Marika’s net worth increased by $62,500. In substance, the mother’s gift brought about a roughly equal increase in the wealth of her two older children.I do not accept that the will was inaccurate. In substance, Marika had received property during her lifetime from Rebeka. The fact that the receipt came by way of Spiro relinquishing his half interest in Wiley Park on the day that he was given Belmore does not make either the words in the will, or in the handwritten note, incorrect.That is not to say that the stated reason was the entirety of Rebeka’s reasons. As will be explained below, I am unpersuaded that it was.Did Rebeka have capacity to execute her will, and did she know and approve it?PrinciplesThe requirements of“capacity”and“knowledge and approval”are distinct, although it is self-evident that the same evidence may bear both upon whether a testatrixunderstood the nature of the act of making a will,the property which was its subject,and the claims of potential beneficiaries, and whether the testatrixappreciated the contents of a will and its effect.Capacity is often associated with what was said inBanks v Goodfellow(1870) LR 5 QB 549, although it is tolerably clear that at least some of the language(notably, the disentitling factors of“disorder[s]of the mind”and“insane delusions”)are inapt today:Carr vHomersham(2018) 97 NSWLR 328;[2018] NSWCA 65at [6], [130]-[134], although theyreflectedwhat at the timemay have beenthe latest state of science.Further, there is, as Basten JA explained inCarr vHomershamat [7]-[11], some imprecision in describing the conventional three positive elements of the test in terms of“capacity”. An understanding of what a will does and of the property likely to be disposed of by the will is qualitativelydifferent from a knowledge and understanding of the persons who have claims upon the bounty of the testatrix.“Knowledge and approval”isalso, upon examination, more complicated than it may appear. The requirementemerged in England from a combination of judgments and procedural changes in the second half of the nineteenth century which became incorporated into New South Wales law, which I sought to explain inLewis v Lewis(2021) 105 NSWLR 487; [2021] NSWCA 168 at [130]-[136].In some cases there may be a significant difference between knowledge and approval of the words used in a will and their effect, a point well illustrated byLewis v Lewis.But that is not the case for this simple will.The simpler the will, the easier it will be to establish both capacity and knowledge and approval. In respect of capacity, White JA explained inCroft v Sanders[2019] NSWCA 303at [126]:Capacity to make a will is to be assessed having regard to theparticular willmade. While the test of capacity remains the same, the application of that test will vary according to the complexity and the officiousness or inofficiousness of the will(Bailey v Bailey(1924) 34 CLR 558 at 570-571; [1924] HCA 21;Brown v McEnroe(1890) 11 NSWR Eq 134 at 138;In the Estate of Park[1954] P 112 at 122;Ridge v Rowden; Estate of Dowling(Supreme Court of New South Wales, Santow J, 10 April 1996, unreported, BC9601342)at 42-43; Mason and Handler,Succession Law and Practice NSW, LexisNexis [13,045] at 100,029,(8)). As the High Court said inGibbons v Wright(1954) 91 CLR 423 at 438; [1954] HCA 17;the mental capacity required in respect of any instrument is relevant to the particular transaction which is being effected by means of the instrument.A recent endorsement is found inLim v Lim[2023] NSWCA 84at [9]-[10].Similarly, the simpler the will, the more readily will it be concluded that the testatrix knew and understood it: see for exampleChalikvChalik[2024] NSWSC 117at [250];Lim v Limat [10].For completeness I note(although I did not understand a submission to be madeto this effect) that even if the will appears to be harsh, or unjust, that does not of itself point against capacity. Gleeson CJ explained inRe Estate of Griffith(1995) 217 ALR 284at 291:[T]here may be cases in which one person’s estimation of another’s claims may seem harsh and unwarranted, and perhaps even unnatural, but it is impossible to assign a reason for that, or to point to any false belief. Testamentary capacity is not reserved for people who are wise, or fair, or reasonable, or whose values conform to generally accepted community standards. A person may disinherit a child for reasons that would shock the conscience of most ordinary members of the community, but that does not make the will invalid.I am conscious that the circumstances attending the making of this will are not entirely free from concern, and I shall apply what was said by Meagher JA inTobin v Ezekielat [47] that:Particular vigilanceis required where a person who played a part in the preparation of the will takes a substantial benefit under it. In those circumstances it is said that such a person has the onus of showing the righteousness of the transaction:Fulton v Andrewat 472;Tyrrell vPaintonat 160. That requires that it be affirmatively established that the testator knew the contents of the will and appreciated the effect of what he or she was doing so that it can be said that the will contains the real intention and reflects the true will of the testator:Tyrrell vPaintonat 157, 160;Nock v Austinat 523-524, 528;Fuller v Strum[2001] EWCA Civ 1879; [2002] 1 WLR 1097 at [33];Dore vBillinghurst[2006] QCA 494 at [32], [42].Let it be assumed, favourably to Marika, that Jim played a part in the preparation of the will. He acceded in cross-examination to the proposition that he discussed with his mother the possibilityofa claim byCostaagainst any inheritanceMarikamight receive from her mother, particularly in circumstances where Marika and Costa made Australia St their post-nuptial home.Even so, I am comfortably satisfied thatRebekahad capacity and knew the contents of her will and its effect.Evidence going tocapacityThere was some evidence ofRebeka’scognitive deficits in 2013.The evidencepost-dated the execution of the 2013 will, but of course that did not prevent it being used to support the conclusion that the deficits were previously in existence.Marika gave evidence of an occasion after her honeymoon, in September 2013, when shesaid“Can you believe that I don’t remember anything from your wedding”. Marika also recalled an occasionin November or December 2013 when her mother told her that she had become disoriented while returning home from Newtown to Australia St in Newtown Memorial Park, a park which she had walked past or through on hundreds of occasions.Marika also gave generalised evidence of an earlier decline.It was saidin final address, correctly, that it was an“astonishing”thing that an event so significant as the wedding of a mother’s only daughter could have been forgotten so soon afterwards. The same is true of becoming disoriented in a park near where she had lived for many decades. However,telling against the force of that submission isthefact thatit was not suggested that any immediate steps were taken to have Rebeka examined by a general practitioner or a specialist.An occasional moment of disorientation ormemory lossdoes not of itself deny testamentary capacity.The evidence before me was that she was first diagnosed with dementia inaroundJune 2015.Agreat deal of objective evidence tells against any serious cognitive deficiencyinAugust 2013. Some of this turns on the fact that other family members’conduct, including Marika’s, is inconsistent with Rebeka suffering from loss of her faculties as early as August 2013. That evidence included the facts that:Marika lived at Jim’s house for 6 weeks in 2014, and although Marika visited her mother every day,Rebekawas living at home independently by herself;Marika travelled to Canberra to visit her husband’s family in 2015 and 2016;Marika’s evidencethatfrom either 2016 or 2017 it became impossible for Marika and her husband to leave home without somebody staying with her mother;Marika applied for, and obtained, a carer’s pension in 2017(rather than earlier);There is also the fact that Marika found out about the 2013 will in 2016 in circumstances whereshe had suggested that the will might need to be updated, to include her niece.There is also direct evidenceof Rebeka’s capacity, derivedfrom the way in which the will was prepared.It is clear thatRebekagave the same instructions to MrKakaroubasas she hadpreviouslygiven to Mr Coombes. She was alone with those men when the instructions were given, and they could only have come from her. Only MrKakaroubashas any recollection of the meeting in 2013, but there was nothing in his evidence to suggest that she was unaware of the nature of her estate(essentially, her house) or those with claims upon it(the three children each of whom was named in the handwritten letter). The will correctly records thatSpiro and Marika had already received a gift of real property during their lives from her, and in so doing records the three people who had the most substantial claims upon her bounty.To reiterate: the will was simple, it is perfectly plain that Rebeka knew the significance of a willand the nature of her estate, anditidentified on its face thepersons with claimsupon her bounty.I am satisfied that Rebeka had capacity to make the 2013 will.Evidence going to knowledge andapprovalTurning to knowledge and approval,the evidence summarised above, coupled with the simplicity of the will,isrelevant.The evidence isabsolutely clearthat on four separate occasions Rebeka confirmed her intention that 75% of her estate go to Jim and 25% go to Marika:on two separate occasions, separated by some days, to Mr Coombes, and on two occasions on the same day to MrKakaroubas. As was emphasised in Jim’s closing submissions, that must be so irrespective of the order of events. It is powerful evidence that the testatrix knew precisely whatwas the effectof a very simple will disposing of a very simple estate.The gravamen of the challenge to knowledge and approval was that the will wronglyrecordedthat Marika had received property during her lifetime. For the reasons already given,I disagree. What was recorded in the will was correct.Undue influenceThe applicable principles were recently considered inSchwankevAlexakis; Camilleri vAlexakis. They need not be restated here. WhileMarika’s claim for undue influence was advanced in the written submissions served prior to the trial,it was not developed in closing submissions.That was an appropriate course to take,in light ofwhat emerged from the cross-examination of Jim and MrKakaroubas.This claim isnotestablished, andcan be dealt with concisely.It was put in writing that Jim exerted undue influence over his mother when he arranged to take her to see Mr Coombes in 2013, when Marika was away, and without informing Spiro or Marika about this, in circumstances where the 2013 will represented a significant change to Rebeka’s testamentary intentions. I accept that Jim took Rebeka to Mr Coombes, twice, when Marika was away, and did not inform Marika about it, and I accept that the 2013 will significantly altered the disposition of Rebeka’s estate. But that alone is insufficient to establish undue influence.I am satisfied that Rebeka hadcapacity, andknew perfectly well what she was doing when altering her will. Both of her older children had in fact received advances in the form of property during her lifetime, on 20 March 1992, and Jim had received no parcel of land. I am unpersuaded that this is a case where Jim preyed upon his mother creating the sense ofanxietyshe felt prior to making the new will.Jim was pressed in cross-examination for why he did not tell his sister of the fact that his mother had changed her will. His answer was that it was his mother’s will. That is inherently plausible.I acceptthat his answerrepresented the best of his recollection. His mother and sister lived together. Evidently Rebeka did not wish to tell her daughter that she had changed her will. In those circumstances, far from there being any obligation upon him to do so, I think it would have been wrong for him to do so–just as it would have been wrong for MrKakaroubasto do so.It was also put to Jim that he contributed to his mother’s fear concerning“the Canberrans”. I accept that he responded to his mother’s concerns on that issue and that he was aware that she was upset by this, but I do not accept that his conduct contributedinany material way to her decision to amend her will.There is another matterwhich bears on this issue. There was ample evidence that Rebeka had said repeatedly that Belmore went to Spiro, Wiley Park/Lakemba went to Marika, and Camperdown was to go to Jim. If Jim in fact exercised undue influence upon his mother, why notprocure her to make a will which left the entirety of the estate, rather than 75% of the estate, to him? It is far from unknown for daughters to be wholly excluded from a parent’s will; a recent example isKouroutisvKouroutis[2023] NSWSC 608.For those reasons, Rebeka’s2013will should be admitted to probate. It is therefore necessary to address her claim for an order for family provision.Marika’s family provision claimThe threshold issue under s 59(1)(c) of theSuccession Actis whether the Court is satisfied that adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancementin lifehas not been madeby the will for Marika.The Court is entitled, by reason of s 60, in determining whether to make an order and if so its nature, to have regard toawide range ofmatters identified in s 60(2), which include in s60(2)(j)“any evidence of the testamentary intentions of the deceased person, including evidence of statements made by the deceased person”.Written submissionsMarika invitedthe Court to have regard to the facts that she was Rebeka’s primary carer and long-time companion, that she hadlived in Australia St for her entire life until leaving earlier this year, that she lived with Rebeka until Rebeka moved into a full-time care facility in June 2020, agedaround82. She pointedto the fact that for some 15 years, between 1999 and 2013, Rebeka and Marika lived together, Spiro and Jim having married and moved out of Australia St, during which period they had dinner almost every weeknight, and would share most meals on weekends, and that she felt obliged to stay with Rebeka because their lives were so intertwined and because Rebeka depended on her for companionship. Marika saidthat she contributed to the day-to-day costs ofAustralia St, thus enabling Rebeka, funded by an old age pension to maintain her lifestyle and to continue living there. Even after Marika’s marriage, she continued to live at Australia St, on the basis that:I did not feel that I could leave my Mum once I got married. By this stage Mum depended on me for her day-to-day needs, financially to meet the expenses of living at home and the maintenance of the Camperdown House. I believe thatshe also depended on me emotionally for companionship.In cross-examination, Marika emphasised this:“how could I leave her after all these years when she needed me the most”.After Rebeka was diagnosed with dementia in 2015, Marikasaid shewas dedicated to her care until shewent to an aged care facility. This includedcooking,dressingRebeka andassistingherwithtoileting. Her evidence was thatshe stopped going out with her husband and seeing her friendsso as toavoid leaving her mother alone at home.She said that“I effectively had no social life and became her full-timecarer”. When Rebeka moved into full time residential care, Marika visited her daily, subject to Covid restrictions.Marikasuffers froma number ofhealth conditions. She has a weak left leg which prevents her from walking stairs, a consequence of an infection after a cyst was removed from her leg in 2021. She has diabetes and high-blood pressure for which she is medicated. She also suffers frommaculardegeneration which requires monthly injections in her eyes(at a cost of $800 per month, $400 after government rebate), which regularlypreventsherfrom working.Marika’s income is modest, especially in comparison with Jim. Her monthly after-tax income is around $4,060. She owns Wiley Park, but it is worth around $380,000 to $450,000, and is subject to debt of around $270,000 secured by a mortgage. Marika says that her financial position is partly due to the financial sacrifices she made in order to care forRebeka. She saidthat from 2017 she dropped her work back to 4 days each week so that she could care for Rebeka, and that she paid for much of the upkeep of Australia St and for Rebeka’s day-to-day needs. She saidthat Marika and Rebeka had split the household expenses since 1999.Marika’s husband Costa,is also of modest financial means. His monthly net income(after tax) is approximately $3,200 and he owns no real estate. After leaving Australia St, the couple live in temporary accommodation.In contrast, the assets of Jim and his wife are in the order of $3.5million, principally their home, which has a small mortgage(it is valued at $3,125,000, with debt of $272,500) and a share of an inheritance in the order of $700,000 which his wife has recently received.Jim pointedto hisownrelationship with his mother, his contributions to the maintenance of the property, and importantly the fact that he was the only child not to receive real estate, directly or indirectly, from his parents. Referring to the preferences expressed by(among others) White JA and Brereton JA concerning the utility of“moral duty”as opposed to“community standards”inSteinmetz v Shannon(2019) 99 NSWLR 687; [2019] NSWCA 114 at [40] and [109], he submittedthat in order to succeed, Marikaneeded toshow that Rebeka, when she left 25% of her estate to Marika, failed in her moral duty, and that in all the circumstances she had a moral duty to provide her with something more. He submittedthatin light ofthegift during Rebeka’s life, and the family circumstances, a 75:25 division was within the range of provision thata testator might be expected to make for Marika. He invokedthe deference to the testatrix’s intentions in light of the limitedevidencewhich is invariably available attrial, as expressed by White J inSlack v Rogan;Palffyv Rogan(2013) 85 NSWLR 253;[2013] NSWSC 522at [127]:In my view, respect should be given to a capable testator’s judgment as to who should benefit from the estate ifit can be seen that thetestator has duly considered the claims on the estate. That is not to deny that s 59 of theSuccession Actinterferes with the freedom of testamentary disposition. Plainly it does, and courts have a duty to interfere with the willifthe provision made for an eligible applicant is less than adequate for his or her proper maintenance and advancement in life. But it must be acknowledged that the evidence that can be presented after the testator’s death is necessarily inadequate. Typically, as in this case, there can be no or only limited contradiction of the applicant’s evidence as to his or her relationship and dealings with the deceased. The deceased will have been in a better position to determine what provision for a claimant's maintenance and advancement in life is proper than will be a court called on to determine that question months or years after the deceased's death when the person best able to give evidence on that question is no longer alive. Accordingly, if the deceasedwas capable of givingdue consideration to that question and did so, considerable weight should be given to the testator's testamentary wishes in recognition of the better position in which the deceased was placed:Stott v Cook(1960) 33 ALJR 447 per Taylor J at 453-454 cited inNowak vBeska[2013] NSWSC 166 at [136]. This is subject to the qualification that the court’s determination under s 59(1)(c) ands 59(2) is to be made having regard to the circumstances at the time the court is considering the application, rather than at the time of the deceased’s death or will.Jim also reliedon what was said inSgrov Thompson[2017] NSWCA 326, where theCourt of Appeal overturned a decision to make an order of family provision in favour of a daughter who had received nothing from an estate the only substantial asset in which was a residential property left in favour of the other daughter. Both daughters had good relations with their mother, but the plaintiff daughter had received an“early inheritance”in the form of an unencumbered gift of property at around the time she had married. White JA, who delivered the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal, said, dispositively, at [76]-[79]:However, in my view the primary judge did err in principle in his assessment of the significance of Rosa’s having been given the Merrylands property in 1985 as her early inheritance. There is no doubt that the primary judge took that transaction into account as one of the material considerations. His Honour did so in considering the provision made for the applicant by the deceased during the deceased’s lifetime(at [102] referred to at [56] above) and as evidence of the deceased’s testamentary intentions(at [106]-[108] referred to at [57] above). In the section of his reasons headed “DETERMINATION” the primary judge referred to the deceased’s having made generous provision for Rosa during her lifetime by, amongst other things, giving her an unencumbered house(at [130] referred to at [60] above). His Honour then went on to say that the level of provision made during the lifetime of the deceased could not alone determine what was proper on the deceased’s death, albeit it was one of the matters to betaken into accountin determining what is “proper”.But in considering Carmela’s competing claim on the estate, the primary judge said(at [133]) that:“Her competing claim is not founded upon any competing financial need, but on her contributions to the deceased, both financially and in other ways, during the deceased’s declining years.”Carmela’s competing claim was not founded only on her contributions to the deceased during the deceased’s declining years. Fundamentally, it was founded upon what all members of the family recognised as her moral claim to the Greystanes property upon her parents’ death because her sister had received an early inheritance of the Merrylands property.Moreover, the deceased and her then husband specifically considered in 2007 whether the passage of time and the changes in their children’s circumstances meant that they should change their existing wills to give further provision to Rosa. They decided that would be inappropriate because “it has always been one house each and Rosa has already had hers”. The deceased confirmed that position by her will made on 16 August 2010.White JA thereafter gave emphasis to afamiliar line of authorities on the deference to be accorded by courts to wills made by capable testators. He cited apassage fromMcCoskervMcCosker(1957) 97 CLR 566at 580; [1957] HCA 82which had been approved by Gleeson CJ inVigolov Bostin(2005) 221 CLR 191; [2005] HCA 11at [24]:This is the kind of case in which it would be much more pleasant to be open-handed with the testator's estate than to confine oneself to the jurisdiction under the Act. But even if I felt sure that I understood the whole situation so well that I could deal with the estate more justly than the testator dealt with it, I should still not feel justified in asserting that when he decided to give the respondent no more than he had already given him, and to leave his estate to members of the family who had been closer to him and to whom he had his own reasons for being generous, he failed to recognise a moral duty which lay upon him.White JA also referredto Dixon CJ’s statement inPontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales(1962) 107 CLR 9at 20;[1962] HCA 19(“The difficulty is that the Court itself can never be certain that it knows all the circumstances.More often than not, one may be sure that the Court knows fewof them”), to a similar statement by Taylor J inStott v Cook(1960) 33 ALJR 447and to the passage inSlack v Rogan;Palffyv Roganreproduced above, andadded at [86]:I adhere to the view I expressed inSlack v Rogan;Palffyv Rogan. To recognise that the court is not in as good a position as a capable testator to assess what maintenance or advancement in life is proper for an applicant having regard toall ofa family’s circumstances, including the relationships between the applicant and the deceased, and the merits and claims of other family members, is not to put a gloss on the statute. Rather, it is to acknowledge the superior position of the testator. The most important word in s 59(1)(c) is “proper”. Until the court has identified what is proper maintenance, education and advancement in life for an applicant, it cannot assess whether the provision made, if any, is adequate. What is proper requires an evaluative judgment that has regard to all relevant circumstances, not merely the parties’ financial circumstances. Whilst the court will know the latter, it will only have an incomplete picture of the former. Of course, the court’s assessment of what is proper maintenance, education and advancement in life must be made when the court is considering the application. That does not mean that considerable weight should not be given to the assessment of a capable testator or testatrix who has given due consideration to the claims on his or her estate..The following passage at [93]-[95] is also apposite:I do not know, and there is no means of discerning, what the “community’s expectation” would be as to the deceased’s moral obligation. I see no reason to conclude that the deceased did not act as a wise and just testatrix in weighing the competing claims of both her daughters on her estate, having regard to Rosa’s early inheritance and the family’s understanding as to the consequences of that early inheritance. Mr Tregenza submitted that the gift to Rosa more than 30 years ago had much less significance than an equivalent recent gift would have had. He submitted that the significance of the gift diminished over time. Whether that is so or not would depend upon the family’s circumstances about which the deceased and her husband were in a superior position than the court to make a judgment. It may be that the Merrylands property was more valuable than the Greystanes property. Carmela deposed(without objection) that that was so, but she had no qualification to express that opinion. A wise and just testator might well consider that Carmela should not be disadvantaged because Rosa did not take financial advantage of the opportunity offered to her. That was evidently the view the deceased and her husband took in 2007 and which the deceased repeated in her will of 16 August 2010.There appears to have been no significant deterioration in Rosa’s financial circumstances after the deceased’s death, or, for that matter, after she made her will. Rosa’s financial circumstances were marked by increasing levels of debt as she embarked on unsuccessful investments or borrowed to service her lifestyle choices. Although the details of Rosa’s financial circumstances undoubtedly changed up to the time of the hearing, it was not suggested that there was a change in kind rather than of degree.The deceased’s moral obligation to Carmela is not determinative(Vigolov Bostinat [123] perCallinanandHeydonJJ). Rosa’s competing claim based on financial need must still be evaluated. But giving the respect that I consider is due to the deceased’s consideration of the competing claims of her daughters I do not think that Rosa has been given less than adequate provision for her proper maintenance and advancement in life, even though that provision is now effectively nil.Oral submissionsMarika’s oral submissions in support of her claim for a family provision order, described aptly as her“back-up case”were brief, occupying two pages of transcript(pp 220-1).Making the assumptionthat both sides’costs would come out of the estate(and very properly recognising that there might be a debate about that), the net estate was just around $2,060,000, such that 25% was some $520,000. It was said that that was not adequate provision, becausethe value ofMarika’s assetswassmall, that insofar as those assets included a modest amount of superannuation, she did not presently have access to it, that the capital available to her did not permit her to buy a modest house in Sydney, and that acquiring a house in Canberra would exhaust the resources available to her leaving her with no cushion for contingencies which were potentially significant having regard to the medical conditions from which she suffered. In contrast, Jim’s assets were so substantial that they could be disregarded.Jim’s oral submissions were also concise.Heemphasised that Marika had not put forward evidence about what she wanted in order to support a claim of more than 25% of the estate, that she could if she wished live in the Wiley Park flat and have a contingency fund left over after discharging the mortgage. Jim said that if she sought provision for accommodation purposes, it was incumbent upon Marika tohaveput forward evidence as to the type of accommodation she ought to have, the reasons for it, an estimate of how much it would cost, and some evidence as to properties of that nature available for purchase.Even if Marika did not wish to live in Wiley Park, she was able to acquire a home in the ACT, near her husband’s family, and advertisements were tendered stating that suitable properties were available with asking prices of $700,000 plus, and $750,000 plus. He also said that there was no evidence of her husband’s bank balance or superannuation.The parties joined issue as to the relevance of there being two reasons for Rebeka’s will: the fact that Marika had received real property during her lifetime and the concern that Marika’s husband or his family might end up with property. Jim said that both reasons wererational, andinvoked the reasoning inSgro. On the other hand, Marika maintained that the fear which motivated Rebeka had the effect of punishing her daughter for getting married, and had the testatrixactually thoughtabout that, then things might havebeendone very differently.ConsiderationI accept that Marika had a very close relationship with her mother, closer than any ofRebeka’sother children, and which involved a much longerperiod of timesharing a household with her, andthat MarikacaredforRebekain her final years. I also accept all of Marika’s evidence about her medical conditions.However, I also accept that Marika, like Spiro but unlike Jim, had received real estate during Rebeka’s lifetime. For the reasons earlier given, in substance this culminated in Marika’s gift on 20 March 1992. For the ensuing three decades, Marika had enjoyed the benefit of ownership of the Wiley Park flat, for which putting to one side funding the mortgage hadcosther $500.I do not accept everything said on her behalf concerning her own contribution to Rebeka’s daily financial needs.As Marika conceded in cross-examination, at least in some small respects, she used funds in Rebeka’s bank account for her own personal expenses. Marika accepted that tobacco purchases recorded as EFTPOS transactions in her mother’s bank account on 26 September 2018 of $87.90and 17 June 2019 of $32.95 were for her own personal use. It seems probable that a purchase of $475.09 from Dan Murphy’s on 24 December 2018 falls into the same category.Further, it is not correct to say, as appears in paragraph 65(d) of Marika’s affidavit sworn 10 May 2023, that:From the time that Mum moved into the day-care facility(in 2017), I have paid for all expenses relating to the Camperdown House. My Mum did not contribute to anything as her old age pension was being used to pay for the day-care facility(from 2017) and the nursing home(from 2020).Those propositions were tested in cross-examination, and Marika made appropriate concessions. What follows is more elaborate, based on an audit of what occurred in the first half of 2018 and the first half of 2020.In 2018, Rebeka was living for the most part at Australia St, but spending many days and some nights at a care centre run by“Uniting”at Petersham. According to a fee statement, Rebeka spent 4 nights and 19 days in January, 11 nights and 11 days in February, 5 nights and 18 days in March, 2 nights and 21 days in April, 24 days in May and 21 days in June 2018, the cost of which was$947 +$1243 +$1394 +$1048 +$792 +$693 = $6117(Jim’s affidavit of 1 August, pp 5-6). Over that period, Rebeka’s pension was $894.40 per fortnight, rising to $907.60 per fortnight in April,with the deposits of pension and withdrawals toUniting coming out of Rebeka’s account. The balance in the accountremained stable(itcommenced at $5940.90 and ended at $5298.65),and it may benotedthat in addition to payments toUniting were regular payments to theInner West Council(presumably for rates)($411.58on 13.3.18and $410.25on 31.5.18),Sydney Water($188.25on 13.3.18and$157.65on 31.5.18) andEnergyAustralia($309.75on 12.2.18,$146.96on 13.3.18and $294.02on 31.5.18), There are also cash withdrawals from the account of $450, $250,$200, $800 and $200 in the same six months.In fact, in thesix monthperiodsummarisedabove, almost $2,000 was paid by Rebeka for expenses which on their face relate to the home in Australia St, and a further sum of almost $2,000 in cash was withdrawn(some or all of which, of course, may have been used for expenses which benefited Rebeka).I have undertaken the same exercise for the first six months of 2020. Rebeka’s account commenced that period with a balance of $5376.39 and ended the period with a balance of $4729.14. There were fortnightly deposits of $933.40increasing to $944.30by way of pension, plus a Covid-related payment of $750 on 8 April 2020. The nursing home charged $58.25 per day(a basic fee of$52.25 plus an addition $6 daily fee for extra services including Foxtel) and all those payments were made from the account. In addition, there were numerous payments to the Council, Sydney Water,EnergyAustralia, totalling in all $975 throughout that6 monthperiod, as well as somesmallEFTPOS transactions atWoolworths(14 April)IGA, Coles(both on 16 April), Aldi(on 27 April),a butcher(on 25 May).Marika’s response when asked about withdrawalsfrom her mother’s account which on their face benefited her(such as purchases from a tobacconist)was, repeatedly,to say“Contra”. She gave this explanationof her meaning:Q. What do you mean when you say it’s a contra?A. Everything my mother ever needed, if I took everything from her bank account from a woman that earns $400 a fortnight - a week, like I said, there were - if I paid for something, I think, “Okay, I’ll pay with mum’s account”, and it contra-ed itself out. My - I always, always looked after my mother.It is not my purpose to beoverly critical. Over thisperiod of time, Marika was very substantially responsible for her mother. I accept her evidence that no relative spent anything like the time Marika spent withRebeka, and one could well understand a minor portion of Rebeka’s money being spent by Marika for her own purposes.The present is the opposite of the case that issadly butnot uncommonly seen in this court where an elderly relative’s bank account is run down by someone with control of it(cfKatsoulasvKritikakis;KatsoulasvApostolatos[2024] NSWSC 67).The only purpose of the foregoing analyses is to dispel the notion which might be derived from Marika’s evidence that she was obliged to spend her own funds to maintain utilities and rates for Australia St while her mother was largely or wholly absent. To the contrary, Rebeka’s pension proved to be sufficient to pay not only for her accommodation in care, but also for the ownership expenses of Australia St.I am bound bySgroand(for what it is worth) I respectfully agree with the force of the reasoning that the parties’forensic decisions inevitably leave the court in a much less advantaged position than the competent testator. I have concluded that in August 2013 Rebeka was a competent testatrix. The reasons giveninher willareaccurate.It is no small thing to interfere with the testamentary wishes of a capable testatrix.It is necessary to place in context the value of the gift of Wiley Park in 1988 and 1992.True it is that it is atwo bedroomapartment, as opposed to the four bedroom house at Australia St. Nonetheless, it was acquired for $115,000, and accepting Marika’s ownMarch 2023valuation of $400,000, she has enjoyed the benefits of ownership for more than 3 decades, including a capital appreciation ofalmost$300,000.In addition, there is force in Jim’s submission that the evidence put forward by Marika of her financial needs, and of her and Costa’s assets, is relatively slight. I also note that Marika’s medical conditions have worsened, but not dramatically since the will was written.I have found that the reasons expressed in Rebeka’s will were not the only reasons motivating its execution. But I see nothing irrational in a mother’s concern that a child who had already receivedagift of real property would, to the extent that she received a share of Australia St, be exposed to a claim by her husband ifhermarriage foundered. I can see how that fear might have great weight in the mind of an immigrant to this country who no doubt through sacrifice and hard work had achieved a position where each of three children could receive some land notwithstanding her husband’s premature death.When those matters are borne in mind, I amunpersuaded thatthe Courtwould bejustifiedin making further provisionabove the25% from the estate to Marikathan was made by Rebeka.Jim’s claim for mesne profitsIn light ofthe above, Jim’s claim to mesne profits does not arise. But it may be as well to say the following.Jim’s claim was from June 2023 toFebruary 2024. The earlier date was chosen to correspond with a demand by the executor named in Rebeka’s will that Marika vacate the property unless she paid an occupation fee; the latter date was when Marika vacated. The evidence of a real estate agent(who was not required to attend for cross-examination) established rent at $1,200 per week until 15 March 2023, and $1,500 per week thereafter. The claim in total was $117,600.I did not understand there to be any dispute about any of the factual integers comprising that claim.Marika’s response, based onMinister of State for the Interior v RT Co Pty Ltd(1962) 107 CLR 1;[1962] HCA 29andRichardson v Richardson[2021] NSWSC 353,was to deny Jim’s entitlement to an occupation fee, because he had notfirstobtained possession.The facts were quite different in the former case, but in the latter(and passing over a complex procedural history) an administrator sued a child of the deceased who had remained in possession of the family home when the will left the entire estate equally between the three surviving children. The administrator said that upon the grant, the home vested in him in accordance with s 44(1) of theProbate and Administration Act 1898(NSW) and thus he was entitled to claim mesne profits against the defendant who occupied it thereafter. Ward CJ in Eq rejected the claim, stating at [152]:Minister of State for the Interior v RT Companystands for the proposition that a claim for mesne profits cannot succeed unless a plaintiff proves that the plaintiffentered intoactual possession or occupation of the subject premises before bringing such a claim. In the present case, the claim for possession and the claim for mesne profits were brought in the same proceeding(see statement of claim filed 29 May 2019), and thus the plaintiffs did notenter intoactual possession of the Epping Property before bringing the claim for mesne profits. While the plaintiff in this case has citeda number ofcases in this Court where mesne profits have been awarded before the plaintiff entered into possession of the relevant property(as to which, see above), none of those cases appears to citeMinister of State for the Interior v RT Companyor to deal with the proposition arising from that case.Her Honour summarised Taylor J’s reasons inMinister of State for the Interior v RT CoPty Ltd, observed thatit had been followed byEdelman J inHampton v BHP Billiton Minerals Pty Ltd [No 2][2012] WASC 285 who had observed at [318] that“the High Court has iterated and reiterated that a claim for mesne profits is one which can only be brought when physical possession is recoveredor after an action is broughtto recoverpossession”, considered the possibility of relying uponthe power to cure procedural irregularities in s 63 of theCivil Procedure Act 2005(NSW)and concluded at [165]-[166],rejecting the administrator’s claim:Fundamentally, the question that seems here to arise is whether the perceived defect in the claim for mesne profits(by reason of the proceeding having been commenced before the cause of action had accrued), at least on the authority ofMinister of State for the Interior v RT Company, is capable of being cured as a procedural defect(pursuant to s 63 of theCivil Procedure Act) or is a substantive issue. Here, where the plaintiffs brought a claim for mesne profits at a time before actual possession of the premises had been obtained, if possession was an element of the cause ofactionthen it would logically fail because that element could not be established at that time. Whether the problem could have been rectified by amendment to the statement of claim to include a fresh claim for mesne profits after actual possession had been taken(albeit one relating back to the date of death) is an interestingissuebut this did not occur.I consider myself bound by the conclusion inMinister of State for the Interior v RT Company(endorsed as it subsequently seems to have been by Edelman J inHampton v BHP Billiton Minerals). Accordingly, I have concluded that the claim for mesne profits fails.In closing submissions,Jimsought to distinguishRichardsonbypointingto s12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899(NSW) which permitted a claim for ejectment to be made together with a claim for mesneprofits, andsubmitted that despite the repeal of that provision(by theFair Trading Legislation(Repeal and Amendment) Act 2015(NSW)),Marika’sdefence should not be accepted.I am confident that the parties did not exchange full submissions on the point.Jim’s submissions on this aspect of the case were supplied on the afternoon of the third day, and it is more than possible that Marika did not have adequate opportunity to respond. Had my findings been different such that the claim had been pressed, I would have invited further submissions from the parties.But the question will recur in other cases(I noteRichardsonhas beenfollowed inNew South WalesCrime Commission v Hindmarch[2023] NSWSC 332 at [9]-[11]), and since thereis now a split indecisions of this Court, it seemsworth noting the following points.First, mesne profitsisan exceptionally unfortunate label to describe a remedy which is used in a number of different senses:see C Mitchell and LRostill,“Making Sense of Mesne Profits: Causes of Action”(2021) 80Cambridge Law Journal130, an article from which I have derived assistance.In the present context, they have little to do with anything that is“intermediate”(whichis the sense of the old French word“mesne”).Norhave theyanything to dowithprofits,and they are certainly distinct from the profits for which afiduciary or some other accounting party may be requiredinequity to account. They are notrent, or damages for breach of a covenant to pay rent, as Brennan J noted inProgressive Mailing House Pty Ltd vTabaliPty Ltd(1985) 157 CLR 17 at 39;[1985] HCA 14; see alsoBivianovNatoli(1998) 43 NSWLR 695 at 704.Indeed, they are antithetical to a claim for unpaid rent, or damages for breach of a leasehold covenant, for their premise is that the defendant has no entitlement to possession. They are insteada remedy for tortious conduct, namely,trespass to land:CiagliavCiaglia[2010] NSWSC 341 at [125].Arden LJ said inRamzan vBrookwideLtd[2011] EWCA Civ 985;[2012]1 All ER 903at [44]:Mesne profits are damages for the loss of use of land, in this case the loss of the use of thestore room. A person entitled to land, usually a landlord where the lease or tenancy has terminated, can claim compensation for being deprived of possession by damages representing either the rent heactually lostor the rent that he could have obtained if he had let the premises.Secondly, inLamruPty Ltd vKationPty Ltd(1998) 44 NSWLR 432 at 435 it was noted that“a claim for mesne profits was in origin an action of trespass and was formerly brought after judgment for ejectment”.Thatpropositionreflects subtleties which may not be immediately obvious to modern readers.As I see it, theissue arises because oftwo historical difficulties.The firstis thatit was said that there was a rule that“a possession in fact in the plaintiff…is necessary to support an action for a trespass”:Wilkinson v Kirby(1854)15 CB 431 at 443;139 ER 492at 497. But thatled toa fiction,“trespass by relation”, to the effect that when a personwho has a right to possession enters onto the landthe personis deemed to have been in possession from the moment when the right to possession accrued.Lord Brougham said of this inCarnegyv Scott(1830)VII Bligh NS 462 at 465;5 ER 843at844:[As] soon as a person recovers possession of the land [in an action of ejectment], that is to say, assoon as he shews that he, and not the person in possession before, is entitled to hold that property, he recovers all the rents and profits from the tenant as far back as the statute of limitations allows him to go in quest of his right.The authorities were reviewed by Tipping J writing for the Court of Appeal inLockwood Buildings Ltd v Trust Bank Canterbury Ltd[1995] 1 NZLR 22 at 32; [1994] NZCA 266; see alsoCribb v FM Custodians Ltd[2018] NZCA 183 at [22]-[24], appeal dismissed [2018] NZSC 90; also seeOliveriv Jones[1999] NSWSC 796 at [3]-[4].A separate difficulty was purely procedural.Speaking generally, it wasnot possible for anoriginating writto plead more than oneformof action.These days, statements of claim containing multiplecauses of action–for example, claims in contract and negligence–areso typicalthat it can be difficult to appreciate that that is a relatively modern development in the history of the common law.Yet J Chittyand T Chitty,Chitty on Pleading(Sweet and Stevens, London, 1836) at 201 referred to the“general rule, that actions in formexcontractucannot be joined with those in formex delicto. Thus assumpsit cannot be joined with case, or trover, nor trover with detinue”. Examples may be seen inCorbett vPackington(1827) 6 B & C 268 at 271-273; 108 ER 451 at 453.That led to an entirely procedural problem, because the action for mesne profits was distinct from and dependent upon an action for ejectment to recover possession.Thirdly,there wasa series of procedural responsesto that procedural difficulty. The earliest wastheRecovery of Possession by Landlords Act 1820(1 Geo 4, c 87).Oneleading guide to practice at common law, R Lush,The Practice of the Superior Courts of Law at Westminster(C Reader, London, 1820), devotes six pages to this statute and, especially, the circumstances in which it didnotapply: at pp 833-838.Essentially, it entitled a landlord to obtain a jury’s verdict not merely on possession but also on mesne profits at the same trial, by permitting“the Plaintiff on the Trial, after Proof of his Right to recover Possession of the Whole or of any Part of the Premises mentioned in the Declaration, to go into Evidence of the Mesne Profits thereof, which shall ormight have accrued from the Day of the Expiration or Determination of the Tenant's Interest in the same, down to the time of the Verdict given in the Cause”in which case“the Jury on the Trial, finding for the Plaintiff, shall, in such Case, give their Verdict upon the whole Matter, both as to the Recovery of the Whole or any Part of the Premises, and also as to the Amount of the Damages to be paid for such Mesne Profits”.To anticipate what follows, s 12 albeit insomewhat modified form,derives from thatstatute.Later Georgian statutes gave other advantages to landlords, including an entitlement to waive the right to mesne damages and obtain by way of penalty double the yearly value of premises for the period in which the tenant held over: seeChitty on Pleading,pp 193-194. This legislation further illustrates the role played by statute in overcoming the difficulties mentioned above.The mid-nineteenth century reforms to the common law courts took a more general approach, and very substantially did away with theoldrule. Instead there was a general entitlement for a single proceeding to join multiple related causes of action.The descendants of these provisions were discussed inNguyen vRickhuss[2023] NSWCA 249at [34]-[40]; see alsoCassanitiv Ball as liquidator of RCG CBD Pty Limited(inliq)(2022) 109 NSWLR 348;[2022] NSWCA 161 at [45].That gave rise to a question whether the general entitlement was supplemental to the previously enacted specialentitlement to include an action for mesne profits upon an action for ejectment, or in the alternative. Initially, the latter course was taken.The result was thats 41 oftheCommon Law Procedure Act 1852(15 & 16Victc 76)provided that“Causes of action, of whatever kind, provided they be by and against the same parties and in the same rights, may be joined in the same suit; but this shall not extend to replevin or ejectment…”, while s 214preserved the special entitlement on the part of a landlord to seek to recover mesne profits at the trial of an action for ejectment.Fourthly, many English statutes were copied in the colony of New South Wales. Therry recorded thatpart of the duty of colonial Attorneys General was“toattend to the Acts of each session of the BritishParliament, andapprise the local Government of such measures as might advantageously be adopted and declared to extend to New South Wales”: R Therry,Reminiscences of Thirty Years’ Residence in New South Wales and Victoria(facsimile of 2nd ed 1863 published 1974, Sydney University Press), p 316.Thesame pattern may be found in ss 37 and 165 of theCommon Law Procedure Act 1853(NSW). Section 37 was relevantly in identical terms to s 41 reproduced above, while s165 was relevantly identical to s 214.FaucettJ explained the change effected by s 165 of theCommon Law Procedure ActinLee v Blakeney(1887) 8 LR(NSW) 141 at 145:Formerly a separate action for mesne profits was necessary. In such action he might have been entitled to recover special damage, such as damages for loss of a contract, if he had given notice. Now, under theCommon Law Procedure Act, to a certain extent these two actions have been combined; so that ejectment is considered not only as an action for the recovery of land, but also for the recovery of mesne profits.Fifthly, apotential difficultyfor modern readersarose in 1899, as part of the consolidation of New South Wales statutes.It will be recalled thatthe large majority ofstatutes enacted between 1897 and 1902, including theReal Property Act 1900, theCrimes Act 1900and theWills,Probate and Administration Act 1898, were part of the consolidation: seeGhamrawiv R(2017) 95 NSWLR 405; [2017] NSWCCA 195 at [71].In that process, the two provisions of theCommon Law Procedure Actwere separated. Section 37 became s 49 of theCommon Law Procedure Act 1899(NSW), and preserved the exceptionfor ejectment:(1)Causes of action of whatever kind, provided they are by and against the same parties and in the same rights, may be joined in the same suit; but this shall not extend to replevin or ejectment.However, s 165 of theCommon Law Procedure Act 1853was re-enactedin a separate statute,as s12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899(NSW):Wherever it appears on the trial of any ejectment at the suit of a landlord against a tenant that such tenant orhis attorney has been served with due notice of trial the Judge before whom such cause comes on to be tried shall, whetherthe defendant appears upon such trial or not, permit the claimant on the trial after proof of his right to recover possession of the whole or of any part of the premises mentioned in the writ in ejectment to go into evidence of the mesne profits thereof which have or might have accrued from the day of the expirationor determination of the tenant's interest in the same down to the time of the verdict given in the cause or to some preceding day tobe specially mentioned therein.Section 12(2) required the jury to give their verdict both on the recovery of possession and for any mesneprofits, andconcluded that“in such case the landlord shall have judgment within the time hereinbefore provided not only for the recovery of possession and costs but also for the mesne profits found by the jury”.Pausing there, that was the reasonthat Taylor J referred, inMinister of State for the Interior v RT Co Pty Ltdat 6, to the fact that“for many years it has been permissible in a number of jurisdictions for a landlord, after a holding over without consent, to combine a claim formesneprofits with an action of ejectment”.Taylor J was referring to the provisions first introduced in1820, andre-enacted within theCommon Law ProcedureActsin some jurisdictions, which in certain circumstances permitted an action for ejectment to be accompanied by an action for mesne profits.New South Waleshad beenone of those jurisdictionssince no later than 1853.Incidentally, it seems thatWestern Australiawas not,a point made inBroadway Pty Ltd v Lewis[2012] WASC 373at [130]-[134]. Hence the discussion of the point inHampton v BHP Billiton Minerals Pty Ltd [No 2]at [290]-[322] is inapplicable in New South Wales, at least to such cases as s 165 of theCommon Law Procedure Act 1853and s 12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899applied, as noted inWilloughby City Council v Roads and Maritime Services(2014) 201 LGERA 177; [2014] NSWLEC 6 at [130]-[132].Sixthly,regardmust then be hadto the effect of the enactment of judicature legislation. Of course, that occurred a century earlier in England than in New South Wales, but in both jurisdictions, the administrative fusion of common law and equity meant that mid-nineteenth century procedural reforms, which had resulted in theCommon Law Procedure Acts, were replaced by a uniformprocedureat common law and in equity. The English approach was found in the rules considered by Wills J inDunlop v Macedo(1891) 8 TLR 43 to which Ishallreturn.The New South Wales approachwas more general. Part 8 r 1 of the Rules contained in Schedule 4 to theSupreme Court Act 1970(NSW) provided that“A plaintiff may, in any proceedings, claim relief against the same defendant in respect of more than one cause of action”, with the rule going on to specify circumstances when the plaintiff might do so as of right failing which leave was required. Significantly, the exception in the case of replevin and ejectment(which had been found in the nineteenth century common law procedure legislation) waspreserved in the English rules, butomittedin the New South Wales rules enacted a century later. The modern equivalent is r6.18 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules:6.18 Joinder of causes of action(cfSCR Part 8, rule 1; DCR Part 7, rule 1; LCR Part 6, rule 1)(1) In any originating process, the plaintiff may claim relief against the defendant in respect of more than one cause of action in any of the following circumstances—(a) if the plaintiff sues in the same capacity, and claims the defendant to be liable in the same capacity, in respect of each cause of action,(b) if the plaintiff sues—(i) in his or her capacity as executor of the will of a deceased person, or administrator of the estate of a deceased person, in respect of one or more of the causes of action, and(ii) in his or her personal capacity, but with reference to the estate of the same deceased person, in respect of the remaining causes of action,(c) if the plaintiff claims the defendant to be liable—(i) in his or her capacity as executor of the will of a deceased person, or administrator of the estate of a deceased person, in respect of one or more of the causes of action, and(ii) in his or her personal capacity, and in relation to the estate of the same deceased person, in respect of the remaining causes of action,(d) if the court grants leave forall ofthe causes of action to be dealt with in the same proceedings.(2) Leave under subrule(1) may be granted before or after the originating process is filed.Seventhly, another change effected by the judicature system introduced by theSupreme Court Act 1970was to eliminate the action for ejectment.The newly created NSW Law Reform Commission wrotethat it would be“necessary to reconcile such Acts with the scheme which we propose”: NSWLRC Rep 7, para 20, and there wasa series of deeming provisions in the newSupreme Court Actprovidingthat references to ejectment were to obtaining possession(see for example ss 8, 79 and 92as originally enacted).To the same end it was alsonecessary to amend s 12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act.As amended with effect from 1972, s 12 provided:Recovery of mesne profits in proceedings for possession(1) Where, in proceedings in the Supreme Court by a landlord, a claim for mesne profits is joined with a claim for possession of land, and the entitlement of the landlord to possession of the whole or of any part of the land is established, the landlord, notwithstanding that he or she has not recovered possession of the whole of or that part of the land, may:(a) unless the proceedings are tried with a jury, have judgment for mesne profits up to the time of delivery of possession of the land for which he or she obtains judgment for possession, and(b) if the proceedings are tried with a jury, have judgment for mesne profits up to the time of the verdict of the jury.(2) A judgment for possession and for mesne profits under this section shall not bar any such landlord from bringing proceedings for mesne profits which shall accrue from the time up to which mesne profits are included in the judgment down to the day of delivery of possession of the land for which judgment for possession is obtained.Eighthly, s12 remained in force until 2020.TheFair TradingLegislation(Repeal and Amendment) Act 2015(NSW)inserted s 1D into what survived of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899and the new sectionprovided that the latter statute would be repealed in fiveyears time.The result is that s 12 was repealed five years after the date s 1D commenced, which is 30 June 2020, in theantepenultimate year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, precisely two centuries after its English ancestor had been enacted in the first year of the reign ofher greatgreatgrandmother’s uncle,George IV.But s 12 was not required after it became possible, in 1972, to include a claim for mesne profits in what was now called a claim for possession in the same originating process.Section 12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899was also potentially a trap, because it did not apply to all claims for mesne profits. Section 12 applied only to claims bylandlords.Section 6A(which was also introduced in 1972) defined landlord to include a lessor, butthatdoesnot advance the matter greatly.AsMacready Mpointed out(and as had been pointed out by Lush more than two centuries ago), not every claim by a landowner will be a claim by a landlord:Oliveriv Jones[1999] NSWSC 154at [25].InRichardson vPedler[2001] NSWSC 221at [46]-[48],Macready M said,inobiter, that there was no pre-existing relationship of landlord and tenant in the case of a son who had obtained letters of administration and sought the remedy against the de facto wife of the deceased.That must be so, and it illustrates the difficultyin relying on what was an earlier and less general and indeed superseded procedural provision, rather than the more general changes effected by the judicature legislation.In my view, the numerous cases in which executors and administrators have obtained mesne profits against widows, widowers and children who continue in possession of land devised to others are correct(see for example, in addition to the six examplesmentioned by Ward CJ in Eq at[85],Finlay v Tucker[2015] NSWSC 560 at [118]-[120];Smith v Smith[2011] NSWSC 938 at [33]-[34];AngiusvSalier[2019] NSWSC 184;Mao vPeddley[2001] NSWSC 254 at [116]-[117]). Although it is true that no reference was made toMinister of State for the Interior v RTCo Pty Ltd, that decision has been inapplicablein New South Walesto claims by landlords since at least 1853, and more generally since 1972.An argumentsimilar tothat advanced by Marika was put by the defendant inDunlop v Macedo. Wills J rejected the submissionin terms which warrant extensive reproduction:Trespass required that the plaintiff should have been in possession, and that the defendantshould haveinterfered with the possession. Here the plaintiff never having been in possession, is only able to maintain his action by a legal fiction, that as soon as judgment in ejectment was recovered and entry made(whether by writ of possession or inpais) the entry related back … Under these circumstances when there had been no actual entry it was necessary to recover in ejectment and execute the writ or obtain possession under the judgment, in order to get the benefit of the fiction, and so get the evidence of possession necessary for the action of trespass and mesne profits. The first inroad upon this was made byGIV,c. 87, section 2, of which the 214th section of the Common Law Procedure Act is in substance a re-enactment, and whichenabled a landlord plaintiff(after proof of his right to possession) to go into evidence of mesne profits for the determination of the tenancy. The right to recover was conferred by statute in such a case, although there had been no entry in fact. To that extent, therefore, the old law was altered, andmesne profits could be recovered on showing that possession ought to havebeen given, but was wrongfully withheld, and the technical necessity was put aside. The rules of the Supreme Court go further. By order 17, rule2,of the rules of 1875, and by order 18of those of 1883, it is provided that no cause of action shall without leave be joined with an action for the recovery of land exceptinter aliaclaims for mesne profits.It means, as it seems to me, that the useless machinery of judgment and entry inejectment, and the subsequent action of trespass with the conclusion of law therefrom(that a possession which never existed had been taken at the date on which the title accrued and the assumption of a disturbance by the defendant of that non-existent possession), are done away with, and the right of the plaintiff to compensation for the occupation of his land without his consent can be enforced in the same action in which possession of the land is sought. The only effect of the recovery in ejectment upon the action for mesne profits was that the entry made under it was the peg upon which tohang the fiction of antecedent possession. Now that forms of action are abolished, it cannot be necessary to preserve the machinery for supporting the legal fiction of possession at a time when there was none, it may be urged that the rule is in terms restrictive, that it will be literally satisfied by confining it to cases already provided for by the Common Law Procedure Act, and that it was not intended to extend the remedy to cases already provided for. The 214th section of that Act is preserved by the Statute LawRevisionAct,1883,and it maybe thatthoughtheframers of the Act did not take upon themselves to expunge the section, yet the effect of the rules may be to render it unnecessary.Ihave given substantial reasons for giving the rules the meaning which for 16 years has been put upon them by the profession. Without possession mesne profits have been recovered hundreds of times since 1875 under precisely the same circumstances.Indeed, since 1875Icertainly have never either seen or heard of a case in which separate actions have been brought for ejectment and mesne profits.The English rules of 1875 were slightly differently drawn from those enacted in New South Wales a century later.OrderXVII r 1 generally permitted a plaintiff to bring two causes of action in a single proceeding. Rule 2imposed aqualification: that no cause of action without leave should be joined to an action for the recovery of land. However, rule 2itselfcontained an exception:“except that claims in respect of mesne profits or arrears of rent in respect of thepremises claimed, or any part thereof, and damages for breach of any contract under which the same or any part thereof are held”. The New South Wales rulesare simplerand more general: they provide generally that multiple causes of action may be joined in the one originating process.And it is to be recalled that when enacted as a schedule to theSupreme CourtAct, they have the force of primary legislation.Subject only to that qualification concerning the difference in rules,I respectfully agreewith the reasoning inDunlop v Macedowhich is applicable in New South Wales after 1972.Dunlop v Macedowas referredtoby Taylor J, without criticism, inMinister of State for the Interior v RTCo Pty Ltd.Section 12 of theLandlord and Tenant Act 1899was in my opinion preserved unnecessarily following the conferral of a general entitlement on a plaintiff to sue for both possession and mesne profits in the same originating process by Pt 8 r1of the new Supreme Court Rules which came into effect in 1972.Nothing turns on its belated repeal in 2020.Jim was entitled to sue for possession and mesne profits in the samecross-claim, in accordance with r6.18(the successor to Pt 8 r 1which was picked up and made applicable to cross-claims by r9.1(3)). When he ultimately obtained possession in February 2024, that related back until he was first entitled to possession, whichin light ofthe grant of probate to which he is entitled, is the date of Rebeka’s death.It follows that I accept Jim’s submissionthat what was said inRichardson v Richardsonas to the unavailability of mesne profits must be regarded asper incuriam. To be fair,there is nothing to suggest thatthe Courtwastaken to s12,nor toany of the historical matters mentioned above,nor to the fact that both Taylor J inMinister of State for the Interior v RTCo Pty Ltdor Edelman J inHampton v BHP Billiton Mineralswere dealing with cases where statute had not intervened.Hadthe claim been pressed, I would have ordered mesne profits against Marika.Conclusion and ordersFor those reasons, there should be a grant of probatein solemn formin favour of Jim, Marika’s summons should be dismissed and Jim’scross-claimshould otherwise be dismissed. I indicated at the conclusion of the trial that I would permit the parties to be heard on the form of orders, including as to costs. Accordingly, the only orders I shall make are the following:Direct the parties to file and serve either an agreed short minute of order, or alternatively proposed short minutes of order for which they contend, accompanied by submissions not exceeding five pages, within 14 days of today, followed by submissions in reply not exceeding three pages 7 days thereafter. The submissions in replyare to indicate whether either side seeks an oral hearing or is content with any dispute to be resolved on the papers.DISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment or decision.
